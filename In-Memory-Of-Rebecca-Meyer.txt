The name of the protagonist of the screenplay Buffy: a Few Good Slayers,
Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd, was inspired by several Rebeccas I’ve met and knew
including my late grandmother on my father’s side (the daughter of
https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F ).

However, 11 days after I started working on the screenplay, I heard about the
death of a different Rebecca, Rebacca Meyer, the daughter of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_A._Meyer , who died of cancer while being
only 6 years old and on her birthday. I did not know her, but heard about her
father and read one of his books and I admire him.

As a result, I'm keeping this as a dedication to her memory.

I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not going to tweet about it, but I'll write a short
dedication about her in my next blog/Google+/reddit/etc. post about this
screenplay of mine: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/
- it has a lot of computer/software dev/open source/open content/Web 2.0/WWW/New
Age pluralism/etc./etc. stuff and the chief protagonist is called Rebecca
"Becky" Shepherd and she's going to be a really awesome heroine/"hacker"[2] (in
my own zany way). Her name was inspired by that of several Rivkahs/Rebeccas I
know, including that of my late grandmother, and if I ever have a daughter I'd
like to call her Rebecca after her[1].

Maybe I'll also put a small dedication to the memory of Rebecca Meyer somewhere
in the GitHub repository of the screenplay. Being a geek, I use git and GitHub
for my screenplays, and they are also licensed under one of the Creative Commons
licences.

Sorry if I've gone off tangent, and my deep condolences to Rebecca Meyer’s
family. I still feel a little sad now - I really do.

Regards,

[1] - Jews of many Jewries tend to call their children after deceased
relatives. So do many Asian Indians, and both Indians and those Jews will take
offence if you call a newborn after a living older relative, because it
indicates you wish them to be dead.

I did meet a woman (and a mother) who was Jewish on one of my walks in the
neighbourhood who was of Argentinian origin and was christened after her
grandmother who was still alive when I talked to her, and she said it's not a
big issue for them. I guess you learn something new every day.
