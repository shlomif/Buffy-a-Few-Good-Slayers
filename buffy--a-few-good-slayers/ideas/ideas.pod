=head1 Buffy - a Few Good Slayers

=head2 About

I<Buffy: a Few Good Slayers> is a new piece of Buffy fanfiction set in a forked
version of the Buffy universe, starting from the end of the third season of
Buffy, while taking place many years later in 2014/2015 Sunnydale. The idea and
concept were created by L<Shlomi Fish|http://www.shlomifish.org/>.

=head2 What happened from 2000/2001

L<Faith|http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane> turned out to have been a
good slayer after all, and prevented the mayor from ascending properly in
the last minute. She joins forces with Buffy and the
L<Scooby Gang|http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang>, as an equal
co-slayer.

Faith starts dating L<Xander|http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Xander>, and they end
up falling in love. Xander grows more confident, and after some training and
some encouragement from Buffy and Faith becomes the world's first qualified
B<male> slayer, paving the road for other male slayers.

Faith and Xander marry after college, and have children. Buffy is able to cure
L<Angel|http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Angel> out of his vampiredom, and he
becomes a slayer, marries Buffy and they have children.

L<Willow|http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Willow> cures Oz out of his
werewolfness, becomes Dr. Willow Rosenberg, Ph.D., and one
of the most powerful witches (or wizards) known on Earth. Oz becomes a superb
wizard as well. he and Willow marry and have some children.

L<Giles|http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Rupert_Giles> becomes the principal of
Sunnydale high school where the whole gang is working as teachers, teaching
next generations of budding slayers, witches/wizards, watchers, etc. making
Sunnydale the Mecca of the slaying world.

L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordelia_Chase> moves out of Sunnydale, becomes
a scholar (Ph.D. + Professor), marries, has children, and mostly stays out of
the way of slaying. She remains friends with the gang and comes to visit
sometimes.

=head2 Theme

The show focuses on the following:

=head3 The Scooby Gang

At their early-to-mid-to-late-30s, Buffy, Faith, Xander, Willow, etc. have to
juggle between various priorities:

=over 4

=item * Their responsibilities as parents.

=item * Their responsibilities as spouses.

=item * Their responsibilities as teachers.

=item * The increasing culture gap between them and their students.

=item * Making sure that Sunnydale, and the world at large, remain safe of demonic activity and oblivious to it.

=item * Their mid-life crisis and their nostalgia to the 90s when they grew up.

=back

=head3 The High School Seniors

=head3 The High School Sophomores

=head4 Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd

One of the protagonist is a high school freshman wannabe-slayer called Rebecca
(or “Becky” for short) who is a Maternal Jewess and being a JAP is part of her
image.

The tagline surrounding her is "You've got a lot of potential."

Heh, it's kind-of-like an in-your-face ironic jab.

Mel Brooks also did some stuff on it.

She's not really a JAP.

And certainly isn't when the film ends and she saves the day several times.
