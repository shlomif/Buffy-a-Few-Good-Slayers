[Buffy: a Few Good Slayers

Tagline: I learned more from my students than I have from my teachers.

Note: This screenplay was written by
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and
is original artwork.]


[Abstract: after Faith turns out to have been a benevolent slayer after
all, and prevented the Mayor's ascension in the last minute, She joins forces
with Buffy and the <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby
Gang</a>, as an equal co-slayer.

In September 2014 when the story begins, there are male and female slayers,
witches, and watchers, and Sunnydale was transformed into the Mecca of the
demon-fighting world with the Scooby Gang now teaching many classes of demon
fighters. They are also almost all happily married and have young
children.

The future looks bright for the demon fighting world as Rebecca “Becky”
Shepherd, a slayer wannabe in the 10th grade as well as Chankey Rajeesh (an
Englishman of Indian descent, with photographic memory, who wishes to become a
watcher) and Cliff Farrel (an all-American, extremely athletic,
warlock/witch-wannabe) become a team, and start studying.

[Text on the screen: Sunnydale High School Orientation Day ; Sunnydale ; California

First few chords of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA">Miley
Cyrus’ “Party In The U.S.A”</a>. Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd is shown
walking in the high school lobby listening to the song playing from her
smartphone that is tucked on her belt. She is wearing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My
Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a> shirt, and has a name tag that reads
"Rebecca Shepherd (Slayer)".
]

Cliff: Yo, brony girl - stop!

Becky: Hey, sorry for not paying attention [she pauses the music]. What’s
up?

Cliff: Chankey here [points at Chankey] and I are looking for a slayer to
complete our team. You don't seem exactly like slayer-material, but since
all the other slayers we talked with were taken , I guess we should settle
on you.

[Becky smiles.]

Becky: sure, I'd love to be team with you. Let's register.

[She uses her smartphone to register.]

Becky: OK, done.

Chankey: [in an English accent] Smashing!

Becky: Chankey, is it? Are you British?

Chankey: Yes, Miss Shepherd.

Becky: “Becky” please.

Chankey: Yes, well, I am of Indian descent and carry an Indian name. I have
photographic memory, and did extremely well in my studies. I was supposed to
start studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow
School</a> (the notorious public school, or what you Americans will call a
“private school”) because I had many friends there, but then became aware
of some demonic activity in Greater London, and was indoctrinated as a
watcher-wannabe here.

+++: I don't have any friends here.

Becky: [Grabbing his hand.] I'm sure you’ll make some.

Chankey: Yes.

+++: So what about you? What’s your story?

Becky: Well, I grew up and lived in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina">Charlotte,
North Carolina</a> (great town!). My mother’s Jewish and I’m kind of a spoiled
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jewish%20american%20princess">Jewish
American Princess</a>.

Cliff: Heh, like Princess Vespa in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>?

Becky: Oh, I love this film, and I love the way she undergoes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis">Catharsis</a>.

+++: Anyway, school was pretty easy for me, and I already finished high school
Math and expected to start studying Mathematics in a local university next
year, when a friend of mine and I ran into a vampire while walking
in downtown Charlotte. He was downright scary, but I tried to be as calm
as possible and ran with my friend into a large diner, where I explained
everything. Luckily for us there were a male slayer and his female watcher
there - a couple.

+++: They took care of the vampire, and after that when we got talking, they
told me that they thought I had a great potential to become a slayer, and I
ended up here.

Chankey: Smashing!

Cliff: OK, OK, God works in mysterious ways - making a brony girl / Miley
Cyrus aficionado into a slayer [cut to Becky, she is smiling and saying
“heh”] and making me, who has practised Martial Arts for years, and is
incredibly athletic (“Buff-y-ed”, heh!) into a freaking warlock.

+++: Anyway, my name is Cliff Farrel, I'm from coastal Florida, and I got
introduced to casting spells by a few local sorcerers and witches. I was
good at it, and they told me I should enrol here and I did. So now I'm
getting to be bossed around by Miss “I’m a J.A.P. and I’m proud of it”
Brony Girl here.

Becky: Listen, for your information, I did some martial arts over in Israel,
when I visited it this summer, and I was told I was pretty good at it, but
more importantly - there’s more to being a good slayer than senselessly
kicking vampires’ ass.

<s id="orientation_day__giles_speech" title="Giles’ Speech">

[Giles is testing the microphone.]

Giles: Mary had a little lamb, little lamb… OK, nice.

+++: all 10th grade students pay attention here. This is Prof. Rupert
Giles and I’m the principal of Sunnydale High School, which as you know
specialises in training slayers, watchers and warlocks-slash-witches to help
battle the world infestation of demons.

+++: Let's start with a brief history of this school:

+++: Buffy Anne Summers and her mother moved to Sunnydale at 1997 and
she quickly found herself fighting Demons again when being in the 10th grade.
Buffy gathered a small group of friends, who helped her fighting demons
called <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">the Scooby Gang</a>.

+++: During the Scooby Gang’s senior year, a young (three years the Scooby
Gang’s junior) and insurgent slayer called
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith Lehane</a> comes
to Sunnydale, having been an orphan most of her life, and growing on the
streets. At first, it seems that she has gone to “the dark side of the force”
to quote Buffy, but she ends up preventing the mayor’s ascension in the
last minute and saving the day.

+++: Faith is adopted by a local couple, starts studying as a 10th grader in
the high school, and joins forces with Buffy as a co-slayer. She maintains
a relationship with Mr.
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Alexander_Harris">Alexander
“Xander” Harris</a> that grows from being primarily sexual, to friendship, to
deep love, and
they remain faithful to each other to this very day. Pun not intended.

+++: With the encouragement of Buffy and Faith, Xander becomes more confident,
and eventually makes history by becoming the world’s first known male slayer,
paving the road to future male slayers.

+++: Meanwhile, Buffy and her long term friend and loved one,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Angel">Angel</a> are able to convince
the Gypsies who restored his soul to use an even more powerful spell to convert
him back into a human. Angel becomes a slayer as well, and he and Buffy get
married and have children.

+++: In a similar fashion,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Willow_Rosenberg">Willow Rosenberg</a> (
now Dr. Willow Rosenberg, Ph.D) is able to cure her boyfriend
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Daniel_Osbourne">Daniel “Oz” Osbourne</a>)
out of his werewolfness, he becomes a fellow warlock as well, and the two
marry and have some children. Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Osbourne are both among
the most powerful known wizards in the world today, so you should stay on
their good side.

+++: Not that they abuse their magic. At least not often.

+++: I myself have married Buffy’s mother, who isn’t a qualified demon fighter,
but nevertheless extremely helpful and instrumental to the Scooby Gang.

+++: In the meanwhile,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Principal_Snyder">Principal Snyder</a>
retired, passed the baton to me, and decided to run for mayor of Sunnydale. He
ended up losing the election at first with a large margin, but didn't give up
and instead offered the newly elected mayor to help him as much as he could.
Snyder proved to be extremely helpful and insightful, and in the second term,
the previous Mayor didn’t run again, and instead supported Mr. Snyder election,
who won it by a large margin, and is still Sunnydale’s mayor, and a good friend
and supporter of the Scooby gang's new role as educators and protectors of
Sunnydale, and the world at large.

+++: What all this shows, is like this fine lady [showing
<a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia">Princess Celestia</a> on
the screen and some laughter and enthusiastic claps from the audience]
would say: the real magic is in friendship.

+++: Fast forward to the present, Sunnydale High School has become the
Mecca for training slayers, warlocks and witches, and watchers. We now have
a lot of competition (and some very good one I might add), and it’s hard to
stay on top, but we know better than to ever rest on our laurels. We accept
students from all over the world, and it’s a big melting pot of cultures,
ideas, and knowledge.

+++: The so-called “Web 2.0” revolution did not skip the world of slaying,
and there are now many blogs, wikis, microblogs, forums, chatrooms, and
other online Internet resources about all that. While it’s really exciting,
note, however that you
should be <b>extremely</b> careful: one small mispronunciation on a spell can
kill you or curse you for a long time, which would be much harder, if not
damn right impossible, to revert. Always research your sources, and make sure
that you are safe.

+++: There’s a lot of pseudo-Mystical junk masquerading in today’s world so
don’t expect the worlds of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld">Discworld</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina,_the_Teenage_Witch_%28TV_series%29">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a>, or even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My Little Pony</a> to be 100% accurate. As interesting, enlightening,
and insightful they are, they must be taken with a huge grain of salt.

+++: Thanks to the growing number of demon-fighters, the demon world has been
kept largely at bay for years. However, we try to get ready for a big demonic
calamity, if and when it will happen. Like the Scouts always say: “Be Prepared”.

[Giles drinks some water from his glass.]

Giles: You have been split into teams of three consisting of a slayer, a
watchers, and a warlocks or witch. You should know what your responsibilities
are.

+++: You can pick up the necessary classes from three different times
in your curriculum. We have midterm and final tests but no homework. [Cheers
from the crowd] Once you finish your classes for the day, you are free to
do as you please.

+++: We are also not a vocational school and teach you the proper scholastic
subjects. We are also always open to hear our students’ criticism or question.

+++: I should also note that while we hope you learn a lot from us, then
to paraphrase on what
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanina">Rabbi Hanina</a> said
in the Talmud, we will learn much more from you.

+++: Finally note that although you have a lot of responsibility, slaying
is fun and rewarding, so make sure you enjoy it. Your Twelfth-grade mentors
will come to guide you shortly.

[Claps and cheers from the audience.]

<s id="becky_in_the_library" title="Becky In The Library">

<s id="becky_in_the_library__the_librarian" title="The Librarian">

[Becky enters the new library of Sunnydale High School. It’s large. The
song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G6QDNC4jPs">“Everytime We Touch”
by Cascada</a> is playing in the background and people are making other light
noises. Becky approaches the librarian, Ms. Chu, who has Oriental looks.]

Becky: Hi, I would have expected a library to be more quiet than that.

Ms. Chu: Yes, but we realised that such sterility is not good for creativity
or for one’s self-esteem. This song actually was a good catalyst for rethinking
our strategy.

+++: Anyway, my name is Diane Chu, and I’m the librarian here. I’m also a
qualified watcher.

Becky: Nice to meet you: I am Becky Shepherd.

Ms. Chu: Nice to meet you. [They shake hands] I think your two team mates are
over there.

Becky: Why, thank you! I’m going to join them.

<s id="becky_in_the_library__chit_chat" title="Chit Chat">

Becky: Hi Chankey, Cliff.

Chankey: Hello, Becky. You were right, I have made many friends.

[Samantha, who is a good looking white girl, approaches Chankey.]

Samantha: Oh, Chankey, there you are! I had a great time tonight. [She
kisses him on the cheek.] We’ll schedule another date using instant
messaging, K? See you!

[She leaves.]

Becky: ooooh... watch it, Mr. Watcher!

[Cliff hits him with his fist.]

Chankey: Heh, tell me about it. What is it about women and Indian men.

Cliff: What is it about women and all exotic men? Or non-exotic ones! girls
here hit on me like crazy, and I’ve had lots of dates.

Becky: Men do that too, by the way. Like… in Israel, lots of men asked my
female friends and I — where some of them were kinda big, not athletic looking
and not very beautiful — on dates, or hit on us in the typical Israeli “smooth”
way.

+++: That’s not all, but I talked with some female Jewish divorcees, and they
told me that many religious married Jewish asked them if they are interested
to have an affair with them.

Cliff: What? Such an affair? How is this…

Becky: Kosher? It is for men based on the Jewish tradition. Not for women
though.

Cliff: Heh, double standards.

Becky: Well, that's Judaism for you.

+++: Anyway, Orthodox religious Jews are attracted to an ethnic Jewess
(like me) like flies are attracted to a piece of meat, because she doesn’t
have to observe for them to have Jewish children. I had many awesome dates
with Yeshiva pupils.

Cliff: That’s great, Brony girl.

Chankey: Cliff, her name is Becky.

Becky: That’s quite alright. I like being called “Brony girl”. It makes me
feel special.

+++: So, Cliff [she flicks her hair], what did you do this summer?

Cliff: Oh, I spent this time in southern California, doing martial arts,
witchcraft and hanging around with friends and celebrities.

Becky: Celebrities? Really?!! Which ones?

Cliff: You name it - I met Chuck Norris for example and fought against him.

Becky: You met Chuck Norris? That's so great! How’s he like? And who won?

Cliff: Oh, he’s great! Keeps saying various aphorisms that I can never tell
if they are from the Bible or not, but, ye know, he’s just being himself.

+++: And he takes losing (like with me - I won two rounds out of one)
amazingly well. Says that he can learn more from a lost fight than from
a fight he’s won.

Becky: Awesome!

+++: Anyway, you probably know that Summer Glau pawns Chuck. She doesn’t have
to hurt you if she doesn’t want to, while Norris kills everyone in sight. It
also takes her a minute to write a rebuttal for a bad blog comment like in
<a href="http://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd: “Venting”</a> and she would sign it as him.

[ Chankey bursts out laughing. Cliff and Becky join him. ]

Cliff: Well, I actually met her a few times including in a fight tournament
where she lost one of the first few rounds. She’s a good fighter, but not
that good. Then she saw me fighting, and asked me if we can fight.

Becky: Summer Glau asked <b>you</b> to fight her? Get out! I’m not worthy…
I’m not worthy… I’m not worthy… Cliff, you’re a freaking wizard!

Cliff: I’m a freaking witch! Anyway, I won all three rounds and she told me
it was a good fight.

<s id="buffy_faith_and_willow_at_the_restaurant" title="Buffy, Faith, and Willow, at the Restaurant.">

[Buffy, Faith, and Willow, are sitting at a restaurant outside, eating and
chatting.]

Willow: So, do you think I should get a dog?

Buffy: Oh, my friend, Rachel, that software developer chick who moved here,
told me that ever since she bought a dog, she made so many friends and lots of
guys showed interest in her, and she’s been telling me about her exploits with
them endlessly.

Willow: So she has become a slut? So cool!

Faith: Hey! “Slut” is such a 90s term. The new name for that is “polyamorous”!

Buffy: Which just rolls off the tongue.

+++: Heh, to be frank, I don’t think she, ahem…

Faith: Reaches fourth base?

Buffy: Exactly! With most of them.

Willow: Maybe she still haven’t found the right man. You know, someone they’ll
both be <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=almost-worthy">almost worthy of each other</a>.

Buffy: maybe!

Willow: Oh, I know. One of my students in the university… he’s a brilliant
software developer, and is really knowledgeable. I can tell him to contact this
friend of yours.

+++: Oh, oh! My cousin’s son: Noam. He just finished his IDF service, and wants
to come to work here in Sunnydale.

Buffy: So, like… Israeli… Jewish…

Willow: Dark complexion… short black hair… and really good looking and
intelligent.

Faith: Yeah, Mama! OK, Buffy, I won’t forgive you if you don’t fix them on
a date.

Buffy: You won’t have to forgive me, because I’ll do it.

+++: I’m so glad we’re not one of those married-plus couples that don’t know
any single people.

Faith: yeah!

[A young man (Daniel) approaches the girls, and asks,]

Daniel: Hello ladies, may I join you?

Buffy: Well, we’re having a girls’ talk, but… sure! Let me introduce myself:
I’m Buffy Summers - I’m a teacher at Sunnydale High School.

Daniel: Wow! The vampire slayer? That’s so great! You’re in large part the
reason I am here. I’m a big fan of yours. Of all of you.

Faith: And who might you be? [She bursts out laughing.]

Daniel: Oh sorry - I am Daniel, I’m new in town.

Buffy: Daniel… what do you say about me fixing you with a date with a very
nice young and single lady I know. Her name is Rachel.

Daniel: Sure, that would be nice.

[Becky, Xander, Cliff, and Chankey are all sitting next to their own
computers talking on Freenode with “rindolf” (= Shlomi Fish) in a dedicated
channel called “#rindolf2”]

Becky: [on IRC] rindolf: thanks for agreeing to meet us here, I’m a big fan of a
lot of the stuff on your homepage and elsewhere, but it seems we have a
crisis on our hand, and we need to consult you.

+++: First of all, your stories are fictional, right?

Rindolf: Indeed, but like I write here:
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/
«Note: many of my stories are not too realistic, and aim to reflect a better
and more idealistic reality than the one many people would perceive. This is in
part because, I am an idealist, and plan to remain so (but my idealism is
dynamic and constantly changes), and wish that my words and deeds will carry
reality forward instead of preserving the status quo.»

Becky: OK, there’s something we need to admit: The show Sarah the Vampire
Slayer, actually has a huge grain of truth to it: there are actually real
vampires and demons, and real witches and warlocks with powerful magic, and
I am a slayer trainee.
