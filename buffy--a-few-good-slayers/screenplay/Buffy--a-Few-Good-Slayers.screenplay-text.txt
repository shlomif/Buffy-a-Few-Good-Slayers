[Abstract: after Faith turns out to have been a benevolent slayer after
all, and prevented the Mayor's ascension in the last minute, She joins forces
with Buffy and <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby
Gang</a>, as an equal
co-slayer.

In September 2014 when the story begins, there are male and female slayers,
witches, and watchers, and Sunnydale was transformed into the Mecca of the
demon-fighting world with the Scooby Gang now teaching many classes of demon
fighters. They are also almost all happily married and have young
children.

The future looks bright for the demon fighting world as Rebecca "Becky"
Shepherd, a slayer wannabe in the 10th grade as well as Chankey Rajeesh (who
aims to be a watcher) and Cliff Farrel (witch/sorcerer) becoome a team, and
start studing.
