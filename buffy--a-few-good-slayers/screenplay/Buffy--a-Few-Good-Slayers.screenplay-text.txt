[Buffy: a Few Good Slayers

Tagline: To be decided.

Note: This screenplay was written by
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and
is original artwork.]


[Abstract: after Faith turns out to have been a benevolent slayer after
all, and prevented the Mayor's ascension in the last minute, She joins forces
with Buffy and <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby
Gang</a>, as an equal co-slayer.

In September 2014 when the story begins, there are male and female slayers,
witches, and watchers, and Sunnydale was transformed into the Mecca of the
demon-fighting world with the Scooby Gang now teaching many classes of demon
fighters. They are also almost all happily married and have young
children.

The future looks bright for the demon fighting world as Rebecca “Becky”
Shepherd, a slayer wannabe in the 10th grade as well as Chankey Rajeesh (an
Englishman of Indian descent, with photographic memory, who wishes to become a
watcher) and Cliff Farrel (an all-American, extremely athletic,
warlock/witch-wannabe) become a team, and start studying.

First few chords of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA">Miley
Cyrus’ “Party In The U.S.A”</a>. Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd is shown
walking in the high school lobby listening to the song playing from her
smartphone that is tucked on her belt. She is wearing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My
Little Pony: Frienship is Magic</a> shirt, and has a name tag that reads
"Rebecca Shepherd \[Slayer\]".

Cliff: Yo, brony girl - stop!

Becky: Hey, sorry for not paying attention [she turns off the music]. What’s
up?

Cliff: Chankey here [points at Chankey] and I are looking for a slayer to
complete our team. You don't seem exactly like slayer-material, but since
all the other slayers we talked with were taken , I guess we should settle
on you.

[Becky smiles.]

Becky: sure, I'd love to be team with you. Let's register.

[She uses her smartphone to register.]

Cliff: OK, done.

Chankey: [in an English accent] Smashing!

Becky: Chankey, is it? Are you British?

Chankey: Yes, Miss Shepherd.

Becky: “Becky” please.

Chankey: Yes, well, I am off Indian descent and carry an Indian name. I have
photographic memory, and did extremely well in my studies. I was supposed to
start studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow
School</a> (the notorious public school, or what you Americans will call a
private school) because I had many friends there, but then became aware
of some demonic activity in Greater London, and was indoctrinated as a
watcher-wannabe here.

+++: I don't have any friends here.

Becky: [Grabbing his hand.] I'm sure you’ll make some.

Chankey: Yes.

+++: So what about you? What’s your story?

Becky: Well, I grew up and lived in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina">Charlotte,
North Carolina</a> (great town!). My mother’s Jewish and I’m kind of spoiled
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jewish%20american%20princess">Jewish
American Princess</a>.

Cliff: Heh, like Princess Vespa in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>?

Becky: Oh, I love this film, and I love the way she undergoes a Catharsis.

+++: Anyway, school was pretty easy for me, and I already finished high school
Math and expected to start studing Mathematics in a local university next
year, when a friend of mine and I ran into a vampire while walking with my
friend in downtown Charlotte. He was downright scary, but I tried to be as calm
as possible and ran with her into a large diner, where I explained everything.
Luckily for us there were a male slayer and his female watcher there - a couple.

+++: They took care of the vampire, and after that when we got talking, they
told me that they tought I had a great potential to become a slayer, and I
ended up here.

Chankey: Smashing!

Cliff: OK, OK, God works in mysterious ways - making a brony girl / Miley
Cyrus afficiando into a slayer [cut to Becky, she is smiling and saying
“heh”] and making me, who has practised Martial Arts for years, and is
incredibly athletic (“Buff-y-ied”, heh!) into a freaking warlock.

+++: anyway, my name is Cliff Farrel, I'm from coastal Florida, and I got
introduced to casting spells by a few local sorcerers and witches. I was
good at it, and they told me I should enroll here and I did. So now I'm
getting to be bossed around by Miss “I’m a J.A.P. and I’m proud of it”
Brony Girl here.

Becky: Listen, for your information, I did some martial arts over in Israel,
when I visited it this summer, and I was told I was pretty good at it, but
more importantly - there’s more to being a good slayer than senselessly
kicking vampires’ ass.
