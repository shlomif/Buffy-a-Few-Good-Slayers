[Buffy: a Few Good Slayers

Tagline: I learned more from my students than I have from my teachers.

Note: This screenplay was written by
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and
is original artwork.]


[Abstract: after Faith turns out to have been a benevolent slayer after
all, and prevented the Mayor’s ascension in the last minute, She joins forces
with Buffy and the <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby
Gang</a>, as an equal co-slayer.

In September 2014 when the story begins, there are male and female slayers,
witches, and watchers, and Sunnydale was transformed into the Mecca of the
demon-fighting world with the Scooby Gang now teaching many classes of demon
fighters. They are also almost all happily married and have young
children.

The future looks bright for the demon fighting world as Rebecca “Becky”
Shepherd, a slayer wannabe in the 10th grade as well as Chankey Rajeesh (an
Englishman of Indian descent, with photographic memory, who wishes to become a
watcher) and Cliff Farrel (an all-American, extremely athletic,
warlock/witch-wannabe) become a team, and start studying.

[Text on the screen: Sunnydale High School Orientation Day ; Sunnydale ; California

First few chords of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA">Miley
Cyrus’ “Party In The U.S.A”</a>. Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd is shown
walking in the high school lobby listening to the song playing from her
smartphone that is tucked on her belt. She is wearing a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My
Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a> shirt, and has a name tag that reads
"Rebecca Shepherd (Slayer)".
]

Cliff: Yo, Brony girl, stop!

Becky: Hey, sorry for not paying attention [she pauses the music]. What’s
up?

Cliff: Chankey here [points at Chankey] and I are looking for a slayer to
complete our team. You don’t seem exactly like slayer-material, but since
all the other slayers we talked with were taken, I guess we should settle
on you.

[Becky smiles.]

Becky: Sure, I’d love to be team with you. Let’s register.

[She uses her smartphone to register.]

Becky: OK, done.

Chankey: [in an English accent] Smashing!

Becky: Chankey, is it? Are you British?

Chankey: Yes, Miss Shepherd.

Becky: “Becky” please.

Chankey: Yes, well, I am of Indian descent and carry an Indian name. I have
photographic memory, and did extremely well in my studies. I was supposed to
start studying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow
School</a> (the notorious public school, or what you Americans will call a
“private school”) because I had many friends there, but then became aware
of some demonic activity in Greater London, and was indoctrinated as a
watcher-wannabe here.

+++: I don’t have any friends here.

Becky: [Grabbing his hand.] I’m sure you’ll make some.

Chankey: Yes.

+++: So what about you? What’s your story?

Becky: Well, I grew up and lived in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina">Charlotte,
North Carolina</a> (great town!). My mother’s Jewish and I’m kind of a spoiled
<a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=jewish%20american%20princess">Jewish
American Princess</a>.

Cliff: Heh, like Princess Vespa in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>?

Becky: Oh, I love this film, and I love the way she undergoes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis">Catharsis</a>.

+++: Anyway, school was pretty easy for me, and I already finished high school
Math and expected to start studying Mathematics in a local university next
year, when a friend of mine and I ran into a vampire while walking
in downtown Charlotte. He was downright scary, but I tried to be as calm
as possible and ran with my friend into a large diner, where I explained
everything. Luckily for us there were a male slayer and his female watcher
there - a couple.

+++: They took care of the vampire, and after that when we got talking, they
told me that they thought I had a great potential to become a slayer, and I
ended up here.

Chankey: Smashing!

Cliff: OK, OK, God works in mysterious ways - making a brony girl / Miley
Cyrus aficionado into a slayer [cut to Becky, she is smiling and saying
“heh”] and making me, who has practised Martial Arts for years, and is
incredibly athletic (“Buff-y-ed”, heh!) into a freaking warlock.

+++: Anyway, my name is Cliff Farrel, I’m from coastal Florida, and I got
introduced to casting spells by a few local sorcerers and witches. I was
good at it, and they told me I should enrol here and I did. So now I’m
getting to be bossed around by Miss “I’m a J.A.P. and I’m proud of it”
Brony Girl here.

Becky: Listen, for your information, I did some martial arts over in Israel,
when I visited it this summer, and I was told I was pretty good at it, but
more importantly - there’s more to being a good slayer than senselessly
kicking vampires’ ass.

<s id="orientation_day__giles_speech" title="Giles’ Speech">

[Giles is testing the microphone.]

Giles: Mary had a little lamb, little lamb… OK, nice.

+++: all 10th grade students pay attention here. This is Prof. Rupert
Giles and I’m the principal of Sunnydale High School, which as you know
specialises in training slayers, watchers and warlocks-slash-witches to help
battle the world infestation of demons.

+++: Let’s start with a brief history of this school:

+++: Buffy Anne Summers and her mother moved to Sunnydale at 1997 and
she quickly found herself fighting Demons again when being in the 10th grade.
Buffy gathered a small group of friends, who helped her fighting demons
called <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">the Scooby Gang</a>.

+++: During the Scooby Gang’s senior year, a young (three years the Scooby
Gang’s junior) and insurgent slayer called
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith Lehane</a> comes
to Sunnydale, having been an orphan most of her life, and growing on the
streets. At first, it seems that she has gone to “the dark side of the force”
to quote Buffy, but she ends up preventing the mayor’s ascension in the
last minute and saving the day.

+++: Faith is adopted by a local couple, starts studying as a 10th grader in
the high school, and joins forces with Buffy as a co-slayer. She maintains
a relationship with Mr.
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Alexander_Harris">Alexander
“Xander” Harris</a> that grows from being primarily sexual, to friendship, to
deep love, and
they remain faithful to each other to this very day. Pun not intended.

+++: With the encouragement of Buffy and Faith, Xander becomes more confident,
and eventually makes history by becoming the world’s first known male slayer,
paving the road to future male slayers.

+++: Meanwhile, Buffy and her long term friend and loved one,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Angel">Angel</a> are able to convince
the Gypsies who restored his soul to use an even more powerful spell to convert
him back into a human. Angel becomes a slayer as well, and he and Buffy get
married and have children.

+++: In a similar fashion,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Willow_Rosenberg">Willow Rosenberg</a> (
now Dr. Willow Rosenberg, Ph.D) is able to cure her boyfriend
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Daniel_Osbourne">Daniel “Oz” Osbourne</a>)
out of his werewolfness, he becomes a fellow warlock as well, and the two
marry and have some children. Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Osbourne are both among
the most powerful known wizards in the world today, so you should stay on
their good side.

+++: Not that they abuse their magic. At least not often.

+++: I myself have married Buffy’s mother, who isn’t a qualified demon fighter,
but nevertheless extremely helpful and instrumental to the Scooby Gang.

+++: In the meanwhile,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Principal_Snyder">Principal Snyder</a>
retired, passed the baton to me, and decided to run for mayor of Sunnydale. He
ended up losing the election at first with a large margin, but didn’t give up
and instead offered the newly elected mayor to help him as much as he could.
Snyder proved to be extremely helpful and insightful, and in the second term,
the previous Mayor didn’t run again, and instead supported Mr. Snyder election,
who won it by a large margin, and is still Sunnydale’s mayor, and a good friend
and supporter of the Scooby gang’s new role as educators and protectors of
Sunnydale, and the world at large.

+++: What all this shows, is like this fine lady [showing
<a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia">Princess Celestia</a> on
the screen and some laughter and enthusiastic claps from the audience]
would say: the real magic is in friendship.

+++: Fast forward to the present, Sunnydale High School has become the
Mecca for training slayers, warlocks and witches, and watchers. We now have
a lot of competition (and some very good one I might add), and it’s hard to
stay on top, but we know better than to ever rest on our laurels. We accept
students from all over the world, and it’s a big melting pot of cultures,
ideas, and knowledge.

+++: The so-called “Web 2.0” revolution did not skip the world of slaying,
and there are now many blogs, wikis, microblogs, forums, chatrooms, and
other online Internet resources about all that. While it’s really exciting,
note, however that you
should be <b>extremely</b> careful: one small mispronunciation on a spell can
kill you or curse you for a long time, which would be much harder, if not
damn right impossible, to revert. Always research your sources, and make sure
that you are safe.

+++: There’s a lot of pseudo-Mystical junk masquerading in today’s world, so
don’t expect the worlds of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a>, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld">Discworld</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina,_the_Teenage_Witch_%28TV_series%29">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a>, or even
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My Little Pony</a> to be 100% accurate. As interesting, enlightening,
and insightful they are, they must be taken with a huge grain of salt.

+++: Thanks to the growing number of demon-fighters, the demon world has been
kept largely at bay for years. However, we try to get ready for a big demonic
calamity, if and when it will happen. Like the Scouts always say: “Be Prepared”.

[Giles drinks some water from his glass.]

Giles: You have been split into teams of three consisting of a slayer, a
watchers, and a warlocks or witch. You should know what your responsibilities
are.

+++: You can pick up the necessary classes from three different times
in your curriculum. We have midterm and final tests but no homework. [Cheers
from the crowd] Once you finish your classes for the day, you are free to
do as you please.

+++: We are also not a vocational school and teach you the proper scholastic
subjects. We are also always open to hear our students’ criticism or question.

+++: I should also note that while we hope you learn a lot from us, then
to paraphrase on what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanina">Rabbi Hanina</a> said
in the Talmud, we will learn much more from you.

+++: Finally note that although you have a lot of responsibility, slaying
is fun and rewarding, so make sure you enjoy it. Your Twelfth-grade mentors
will come to guide you shortly.

[Claps and cheers from the audience.]

[Becky enters the new library of Sunnydale High School. It’s large. The
song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G6QDNC4jPs">“Everytime We Touch”
by Cascada</a> is playing in the background and people are making other light
noises. Becky approaches the librarian, Ms. Chu, who has Oriental looks.]

Becky: Hi, I would have expected a library to be more quiet than that.

Ms. Chu: Yes, but we realised that such sterility is not good for creativity
or for one’s self-esteem. This song actually was a good catalyst for rethinking
our strategy.

+++: Anyway, my name is Diane Chu, and I’m the librarian here. I’m also a
qualified watcher.

Becky: Nice to meet you: I am Becky Shepherd.

Ms. Chu: Nice to meet you. [They shake hands] I think your two team mates are
over there.

Becky: Why, thank you! I’m going to join them.

<s id="becky_in_the_library__chit_chat" title="Chit Chat">

Becky: Hi Chankey, Cliff.

Chankey: Hello, Becky. You were right, I have made many friends.

[Samantha, who is a good looking white girl, approaches Chankey.]

Samantha: Oh, Chankey, there you are! I had a great time tonight. [She
kisses him on the cheek.] We’ll schedule another date using instant
messaging, K? See you!

[She leaves.]

Becky: Ooooh... watch it, Mr. Watcher!

[Cliff hits him with his fist.]

Chankey: Heh, tell me about it. What is it about women and Indian men?

Cliff: What is it about women and all exotic men? Or non-exotic ones! Girls
here hit on me like crazy, and I’ve had lots of dates.

Becky: Men do that too, by the way. Like… in Israel, lots of men asked my
female friends and I — where some of them were kinda big, not athletic looking
and not very beautiful — on dates, or hit on us in the typical Israeli “smooth”
way.

+++: That’s not all, but I talked with some female Jewish divorcees, and they
told me that many religious married Jewish asked them if they are interested
to have an affair with them.

Cliff: What? Such an affair? How is this…

Becky: Kosher? It is for married men based on the Jewish Law. Not for
women though.

Cliff: Heh, double standards.

Becky: Well, that’s Judaism for you.

+++: Anyway, Orthodox religious Jews are attracted to ethnic Jewesses
(like me) like flies are attracted to a piece of meat, because we don’t
have to observe for them to have Jewish children. I had many awesome dates
with Yeshiva pupils.

Cliff: That’s great, Brony girl.

Chankey: Cliff, her name is “Becky”.

Becky: That’s quite alright. I like being called “Brony girl”. It makes me
feel special.

+++: So, Cliff [she flicks her hair], what did you do this summer?

Cliff: Oh, I spent this time in southern California, doing martial arts,
witchcraft and hanging around with friends and celebrities.

Becky: Celebrities? Really?!! Which ones?

Cliff: You name it - I met Chuck Norris for example and fought against him.

Becky: You met Chuck Norris? That’s so great! How’s he like? And who won?

Cliff: Oh, he’s great! Keeps saying various aphorisms that I can never tell
if they are from the Bible or not, but, ye know, he’s just being himself.

+++: And he takes losing (like with me - I won two rounds out of three)
amazingly well. Says that he can learn more from a lost fight than from
a fight he’s won.

Becky: Awesome!

+++: Anyway, you probably know that
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Summer
Glau pawns Chuck</a>. She doesn’t have
to hurt you if she doesn’t want to, while Norris kills everyone in sight. It
also takes her a minute to write a rebuttal for a bad blog comment like in
<a href="http://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd: “Venting”</a>, and she would sign it as
him.

[ Chankey bursts out laughing. Cliff and Becky join him. ]

Cliff: Well, I actually met her a few times including in a fight tournament
where she lost one of the first few rounds. She’s a good fighter, but not
that good. Then she saw me fighting, and asked me if we can fight.

Becky: Summer Glau asked <b>you</b> to fight <b>her</b>? Get out! I’m not
worthy… I’m not worthy… I’m not worthy… Cliff, you’re a freaking wizard!

Cliff: I’m a freaking witch! Anyway, I won all three rounds and she told me
it was a good fight.

<!-- / becky_in_the_library__chit_chat -->

<s id="becky_in_the_library__with_buffy" title="With Buffy">

Becky: of course, everyone knows that Buffy is better than Chuck
[<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Buffy/">Buffy
Facts</a>]. He’s been secretly fighting against her, and so far lost each
of those battles.

Cliff: Yeah, and her gaze can turn Medusa into stone!

Chankey: Buffy Summers is not afraid of demons. Demons are afraid of her, and
for a very good reason.

Buffy’s voice: Buffy Summers is always there when people are spreading
untrue hyperboles about her.

Cliff: Oh, hello Ms. Summers.

[Buffy approaches them from a different aisle in the library.]

Buffy: Hello, kids.

Cliff: By the way, what is your post-marriage name?

Buffy: It’s “Summers”. Angel and I are both called that. He didn’t find his
original family name usable in this day and age, so he adopted mine. His
original name was very aristocratic, and he is actually a direct male
descendent of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>.

Becky: Ooooh… so you are now Milady de Summers? Awesome!

Buffy: Heh, well, it is Faith that has an unnatural obsession with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de-Winter</a>
— not me.

+++: In any case, for your information, I fought against Chuck Norris several
times and lost all the battles. In fact, that was part of the catalyst that
made us realise that slayers were only humans and that men can be equally as
capable slayers as women. You will hopefully get a chance to meet and even
fight against Mr. Norris sometime throughout the school year.

Becky: I see. So, Ms. Summers, what are you doing here in the library?

Buffy: I’m looking for a book I misplaced.

Becky: About slaying?

Buffy: No, about cooking. A cookbook from the late 60s with a nice spinach,
brocolli and cheese caserole.

Becky: [Types a few things on the keyboard.] Ms. Summers, I was able to find
a recipe for a caserole like that from that era.

Buffy: Let me see. [Looks] Wow! Looks great. Becky, you've got a lot of
potential as a slayer.

Becky: Why, thank you!

Cliff: Bleh! [He puts his head in his hands.]

Willow: So, do you think I should get a dog?

Buffy: Oh, my friend, Rachel, that software developer chick who moved here,
told me that ever since she bought a dog, she made so many friends and lots of
guys showed interest in her, and she’s been telling me about her exploits with
them endlessly.

Willow: So she has become a slut? So cool!

Faith: Hey! “Slut” is such a 90s term. The new name for that is “polyamorous”!

Buffy: Which just rolls off the tongue.

+++: Heh, to be frank, I don’t think she, ahem…

Faith: Reaches <a href="http://xkcd.com/540/">fourth base</a>?

Buffy: Exactly! With most of them.

Willow: Maybe she still haven’t found the right man. You know, someone they’ll
both be <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=almost-worthy">almost worthy of each other</a>.

Buffy: maybe!

Willow: Oh, I know. One of my students in the university… he’s a brilliant

finished his Israeli military service, and wants to come to work here in
Sunnydale.

Buffy: So, like… Israeli… Jewish…

Willow: Dark complexion… short black hair… and really good looking and
intelligent.

Faith: Yeah, Mama! OK, Buffy, I won’t forgive you if you don’t fix them on
a date.

Buffy: You won’t have to forgive me, because I’ll do it.

+++: I’m so glad we’re not one of those married-plus couples that don’t know
any single people.

Faith: yeah!

[A young man (Daniel) approaches the girls, and asks,]

Daniel: Hello ladies, may I join you?

Buffy: Well, we’re having a girls’ talk, but… sure! Let me introduce myself:
I’m Buffy Summers - I’m a teacher at Sunnydale High School.

Daniel: Wow! The vampire slayer? That’s so great! You’re in large part the
reason I am here. I’m a big fan of yours. Of all of you.

Faith: And who might you be? [She bursts out laughing.]

Daniel: Oh sorry - I am Daniel, I’m new in town.

Buffy: Or vampires, or other demons, or nuclear weapons!

Xander: All right, all right. We should hide it somewhere until we figure it
out. I think I’ll give it to the people I know at the National Treasury, they
can handle demons and other bad elements of society well enough.

vampires and demons, and real witches and warlocks with powerful magic, and

Mandrake</i></a>, I guess I have no choice but to play along.

Becky: Yes, I guess. Anyway, thing is - we ran into a certain artefact from
<a href="http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Selinaverse">the Selinaverse
world</a> which you describe, namely a duplicator that is the property
of the Q Continuum.

Rindolf: How strange.

Becky: Yes, and it was used to duplicate a real vampire into a large number
of pseudo-vampires.

Rindolf: Wow! This seems like a huge crisis.

Buffy: It sure is.

Rindolf: Well, what do you suggest that we do? Is it my fault?

Buffy: No, it likely isn´t. Just stick in there.

Rindolf: It’s interesting that you say that <i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i>
was partly ingrained in truth. I recall being so in love with Natalie Portman
who was the Alpha Female during the haydays of Web 1.0 despite her being
underage, and her doing SaVS on T.V. in 2002 sort-of terminated her reign
as that, while giving way to Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus, Paris
Hilton, and Jennifer Lawrence (♥!) in roughly that order.

Cliff: Oh, don’t get me started on Paris and Miley…

Rindolf: Anyway, these are my two favourite parts from the show:

<s id="sarah_the_vamp_slayer__date_with_the_yeshivah_pupil" title="Sarah the Vampire Slayer - Date with the Yeshivah Pupil">

[<i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i> featuring Natalie Portman as
Sarah Anne Eisenman, an Ethnic, Reform, Jewish slayer.

Sarah is sitting in a restaurant on a date with Yaakov, a Yeshivah Pupil
from a local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad">Chabad</a> Yeshiva.
]

Sarah: So how's life in the Yeshivah?

Yaakov: Oh, you know, studies, studies and studies.

Sarah: Yes, I know. I need to study as a slayer. And as a high school student
as well.

+++: By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask: what’s the deal with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic">Messianic</a> nature of
Chabad?

Yaakov: Oh that. First of all, it’s a kinda small minority of us, and secondly
it’s kinda rooted in the belief that at any time, every Jew must consider
themselves
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/the-eternal-jew/change_the_world.html">the
Messiah</a> and behave accordingly, which will eventually bring the Jewish
people and the world at large to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation">salvation</a> and prosperity.

Sarah: [Thinks for a moment] Hmmm… I can relate to it.

+++: Tell you what, though? I need to go to the bathroom now. You know: girl
things.

Yaakov: Sure, I'll be here waiting for the food.

[Sarah goes to the bathroom and notices a vampires’ couple getting
ready for action. She rushes back to Yaakov.]

Sarah: Hey, Yaakov. Listen, we have a crisis here and you need to act like
the Messiah. Can you take your book of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehilim">Tehilim</a> and read from it
when I tell you?

Yaakov: I guess! [He rises up and follows her.]

[They go to meet the vampires.]

Sarah: Now, Yaakov!

[Yaakov starts reciting the Psalms. The vampires are terrified. Sarah
slays them using a stake.]

Sarah: Eat dust, bastards!

Yaakov: Wow! What was that?

Sarah: Vampires! I cannot believe I’ve had to put you through that on our
first date.

Yaakov: That's OK… that’s OK… [scared] I can handle it.

Sarah: It’s over. It’s over. Come let’s return to our table.

[She turns to face him. They look at each other for some seconds and then
start to kiss one another and make out.

They do it for a while until a girl enters from the restaurant, and looks at
them.]

Restaurant Girl: Get a room!

[Sarah and Yaakov smile and go on.]

<s id="sarah_the_vamp_slayer__not_a_nobody" title="Sarah the Vampire Slayer - Not a Nobody">

[<i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i> featuring Natalie Portman as
Sarah Anne Eisenman, an Ethnic, Reform, Jewish slayer.]

Ken: [to Lily] Who are you?

Lily: I’m a nobody.

Ken: [to Sarah] And who are you?

Sarah: I’m Sarah Eisenman. A Jewish vampire slayer. And who are you?

Ken: …Bitch!

[Sarah quickly pokes Ken’s eyes with two of her fingers, and kicks him in the
crotch. He falls to the floor agonising in pain.]

Sarah: Yeah, I’m a bitch alright. OK, let’s blow this joint.

[She goes and Lily and the other follow.]

Ken: Hold on, hold on. Well played, Ma’am and frankly, I am miserable here.
I wish there was a way you could help me.

Sarah: Tell you what, Ken? Why not come to the diner, and I’ll pay for your
food and drinks. I’ve been earning quite a lot of cash from tips. You can tell
us stories from this dimension of evil of yours.

[Cut to the diner, Ken is sitting there surrounded by many people who are
listening to his stories.]

Ken: So I told them: “Actually, I have always expected the Spanish Inquisition,
and, on the other hand, they have never expected me.”

[Many members of the audience laugh. Applause.]

Sarah: Ken, would you like some more juice?

Ken: No, Sarah, that's OK, I’m stuffed. Anyway, I think I’ll return to my
dimension of evil now - they will be clueless without me. Thanks for everything.

Sarah: You’re welcome!

[She goes to the counter with Lily.]

Lily: Wow, I earned so much money from tips today. I could totally see myself
working here.

Sarah: Then why don’t you? I earned enough money working here anyway, and now
I’d like to return home.

Lily: Wow, that’s great! Say, can I be Anne now?

Sarah: Lily Anne O’Connor? I guess.

+++: Hold it! The Hebrew equivalent of “Lily” is “Susan” or “Suzanne”, so you
could be Lily Suzanne O’Connor.

Lily: Wow! Awesome.

[Sarah and Lily hug.]

<s id="rindolf_about_SaVS_freenode_2" title="Rindolf about Sarah the Vampire Slayer">

Rindolf: Yes, one thing I liked is that the characters SaVS were both
competent and able, and yet not socially or sexually inept, which I felt was
a long-term false dichotomy. I feel it’s a shame that Joss Whedon and
Nat Portman did not get an Emmy for that, even though they were nominated.

+++: So how come it's based on your life?

Buffy: Well, I originally told the creator of the show (who was a really good
initial student of us) about my life as a slayer, and that I have a feeling
that I have an alter ego / kindred spirit called Sarah who is a liberal
Jewish girl who was a substantial much coveted “Alpha Female” (as you put it)
at the time. Crazy, right?

Rindolf: A bit, yes, but I’ve seen much worse here.

+++: Now the question is - if <i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i> was to be
remade - who would play her?

Buffy: What about Natalie again?

Rindolf: Well, the way I see it, she already won the Oscar and is
married-plus, so she’s kinda old school. But what about Jennifer Lawrence?

Cliff: I know! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox">Megan
Fox</a>…♥!

Rindolf: Sounds good. Or maybe Summer Glau…

Cliff: Yes, I met them both this summer. Both are great people.

Becky: And he fought Glau! And won!

Rindolf: Heh, sounds great.

[ Willow is sitting next to the computer reading. She is kinda worried. ]

Deborah: [= Willow’s daughter, voice from the other room.] Mummy, can you come
and read me a bed-time story?

[Music: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sXxhp9Zcow">Darin: “B what U wanna B”</a> (lyrics).

Willow enters the room. It is not too large, there are some dolls of
My Little Pony, Sesame Street, Disney films, etc. but not too many. There's a
computer in one corner, where Deborah is sitting. She is 6 years old.]

Willow: Hi, sweetie.

Deborah: Hi, mummy. I’m watching Classical Sesame Street and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeDlO0Vy9JQ">Bert taught his pigeon
to play checkers</a>.

Willow: That's great, Deb. OK, are you ready to go to sleep?

Deborah: Yes, mum.

Willow: OK. [She gets her ready there.] Say, sweetie, do you know what my
work is all about?

Deborah: Yes, you’re a professor of Computer Science at Sunnydale University,
and also a teacher at the high school.

Willow: Well, yes, but do you know more than that?

Deborah: Actually, I do: you’re a witch! You help fight demons. And daddy’s
a warlock!

Willow: Yes, Deborah, you are right. We tried to hide it from you, but I
guess we should not have. We should have been more honest.

Deborah: That’s quite alright, mummy. See, my friend told me his father who
is a Philosophy professor told him that honesty is an active process, and
that we are always more dishonest in the past. I forgive you.

+++: Mum, will I be a witch?

Willow: Not if you don’t want to be.

Deborah: Great, because I want to be a [emulating a Scottish accent] postwoman
when I grow up.

Willow: Really? That's great.

Deborah: Yeah, I've been helping Mr. Gillan who is our mailman a little, and
he told me that I can help the mailmen after I turn 13. He’s a Scotsman from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness">Inverness</a>.

Willow: That’s really cool, princess.

Deborah: Yes, well, I think I’ll go to sleep without a story today.

Willow: OK, which doll do you want to sleep with tonight?

Deborah: I think I’ll have
<a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Fluttershy">Fluttershy</a> today.

Willow: [Brings the doll] Here you go.

Deborah: Thanks, mummy.

Willow: You're welcome, munchkin. Listen, as you know, I have powerful and
real magic and I’ll do my best to make sure that no harm will ever come to
you or to any of our friends or any other person in the world.

Deborah: Yes, mummy, I know.

Willow: Good night. [she turns off the light and kisses her on the forehead.]

Deborah: Night.

<s id="becky-chankey-and-faith-in-the-library" title="Becky, Chankey, and Faith">

[Becky and Chankey are sitting in the library studying together listening to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZddsmoEsI">Cimorelli
- “When I’m gone”</a> . Faith approaches them.]

Faith: Hmm... hi kids! That doesn’t sound exactly like Anna Kendrick.

+++: Whoa, who are all those girls?

Becky: Oh, they are Cimorelli - six sisters who sing together. They are
a big hit on YouTube.

Faith: Six sisters!

Chankey: And they also have some brothers.

Faith: Heh, God bless their mother. After my third pregnancy (to twins) I
said: "That’s it. No way, José!".

+++: I would think their being a big family is part of their charm.

Chankey: Yes, and the way I see it: all the power to them. See: I read
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea">20,000
Leagues Under the Sea</a> as a child, and I ended up memorising the English
translation and now the French original, because I liked it so much.

+++: Anyway, Captain Nemo there, thinks he’s a nobody, which is what "Nemo"
means in Latin, but he's not. Thing is: lots of people expressed interest
in him due to his qualities, and he kept thinking: "They are interested in
tangential stuff, not in the real me. They don't know the real me."

+++: And here's the thing: all these qualities are what make you who you
are, and you should exploit them and be yourself.

Faith: Indeed!

+++: Wish I had any sisters. Or brothers for that matter. But I was my
mother's only child, and my poor excuse for a father was a U.S. Navy sailor
who got drunk along with my mother, they had sex, and the bastard bought
her breakfast the day later, gave her his contact details and left.

+++: They told me it was the only time she ever had sex. [Faith starts
crying.]

+++: When I was 5, my mother was killed by some criminals who spared my life,
and we agreed to pretend that I was also killed. So I grew up on the streets.

+++: Then one day when I was 9, I took the bus to one of my city’s good
neighbourhood where I saw a young boy about my age about 90% the way out of
a book.

[Cut to the scene with the young faith and the young boy (= David).]

Faith: Hey homeboy, so this book’s interesting?

David: Hi! Yes, it is.

Faith: [looks at the book] "The Three Musketeers" - think I’ve heard of it.
So it’s good?

David: Yes, it’s great.

Faith: [snatches the book] That book’s mine, bitch!

David: Hey that’s OK - you can have it - I’ll just buy a new one. Bye!

Faith: [from the distance] See ya, homeboy.

Faith’s internal dialogue: It took me a day to finish reading the book. I could
not put it down. The next day, I decided to return it to David.

Faith: Hey, bitch, here’s your book back.

David: Thank you…ahem…

Faith: Faith! My name’s "Faith".

David: Nice to meet you - I’m David. I didn’t buy a new book yet.

Faith: That’s good, I suppose. Oh, and they kill Milady de-Winter there.

David: Really? I positively love her, she’s amazing.

Faith: Agreed. Well, I’m off to my original hood. [She runs.]

David: Faith… wait!

Faith: Fare well, loser.

[Cut to Faith in the Library.]

Faith: So I Grew up in the streets, learned to slay vampires and other demons,
and—had sex - lots of lots of sex. I lost track of the number of guys I
seduced, but I still remember each one.

+++: Then I came to Sunnydale, pretended to be evil and ended up saving the
day. I was then adopted by the O’Sullyvans here, but… but… it’s not the same.

+++: I want my daddy! [Bursts out crying harder.]

[Becky walks to her and hugs her.

After a while Faith calms down a little.]

Faith: Oh, look at me: Faith, the fierce vampire slayer, crying like a baby!
I’m so pathetic!

Xander: [From the background of the frame.] Crying does not make you weak,
Faith. On the contrary - it’s one way of fighting.

Faith: Hey, honey! You remember Becky and Chankey.

Xander: That I do, Faithy [he hugs her].

[Faith puts her head in Xander’s chest affectionately.]

Becky: Faith, do you know what happened to that boy David.

Faith: that I do: he found me on the Internet, a few years back, and we
touched base. He’s also happily married plus children and is an expert
for Internet marketing and e-Commerce. He came to visit me in Sunnydale,
and brought his children with him, and mine got along very nicely with his.

+++: He brought the copy of <i>The Three Musketeers</i> that I stole
and returned, and asked me if I wanted it. I had my own book that I bought
after I came to Sunnydale, but was excited to see the copy in question.

+++: And finally, he also told me that at the time, his father
had been in touch with some couples who were looking to adopt children
my age, and they would have been able to find a couple that could have
adopted me.

Becky: Oh! [She has tears in her eyes.]

Faith: Yes, well, that's all over now I guess.

+++: Bye, kids.

Xander: Bye Becky, Chankey.

Becky and Chankey: Bye Mr. and Mrs. Harris!

[They leave.]
