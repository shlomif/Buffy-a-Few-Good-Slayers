[Buffy: a Few Good Slayers

Tagline: I learned more from my students than I have from my teachers.

Note: This screenplay was written by
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and
is original artwork.]


[Abstract: after Faith turns out to have been a benevolent slayer after
all, and prevented the Mayor’s ascension in the last minute, She joins forces
with Buffy and the <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby
Gang</a>, as an equal co-slayer.

In September 2014 when the story begins, there are male and female slayers,
witches, and watchers, and Sunnydale was transformed into the Mecca of the
demon-fighting world with the Scooby Gang now teaching many classes of demon
fighters. They are also almost all happily married and have young
children.

The future looks bright for the demon fighting world as Rebecca “Becky”
Shepherd, a slayer wannabe in the 10th grade, as well as Chankey Rajeesh (an
Englishman of Indian descent, with photographic memory, who wishes to become a
watcher) and Cliff Farrel (an all-American, extremely athletic,
warlock/witch-wannabe) become a team, and start studying.

[Text on the screen: Sunnydale High School Orientation Day ; Sunnydale ; California

First few chords of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA">Miley
Cyrus’ “Party In The U.S.A”</a>. Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd is shown
walking in the high school lobby listening to the song playing from her
smartphone that is tucked on her belt. She is wearing a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My
Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a> shirt, and has a name tag that reads
"Rebecca Shepherd (Slayer)".
]

Cliff: Yo, Brony girl, stop!

Becky: Hey, sorry for not paying attention [she pauses the music]. What’s
up?

Cliff: Chankey here [points at Chankey] and I are looking for a slayer to
complete our team. You don’t seem exactly like slayer-material, but since
all the other slayers we talked with were taken, I guess we should settle
on you.

[Becky smiles.]

Becky: Sure, I’d love to be team with you. Let’s register.

[She uses her smartphone to register.]

Becky: OK, done.

Chankey: [in an English accent] Smashing!

Becky: Chankey, is it? Are you British?

Chankey: Yes, Ms. Shepherd.

Becky: “Becky” please.

Chankey: Yes, well, I am of Indian descent and carry an Indian name. I have
photographic memory, and did extremely well in my studies. I was supposed to
start studying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow
School</a> (the notorious public school, or what you Americans will call a
“private school”) because I had many friends there, but then became aware
of some demonic activity in Greater London, and was indoctrinated as a
watcher-wannabe here.

+++: I don’t have any friends here.

Becky: [Grabbing his hand.] I’m sure you’ll make some.

Chankey: Yes. Most of my friends who have been kept out of the demonic
underworld loop thought I was crazy for going to "Sunnydale High School"
rather than to Harrow, which is the second most prestigious school
in Britain.

Cliff: Heh, well, my friends accept the fact that I'm <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/indiv-nodes/selina-and-the-three.xhtml">getting weirder, but more amusing in the process</a>. I wish I could completely stop
speaking in riddles, but I cannot copy my mind into the outside world, and
there are stupid trolls on online forums and subforums.

Chankey: Heh, my thoughts exactly.

+++: Anyway, Becky, what about you? What’s your story?

Becky: Well, I grew up and lived in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina">Charlotte,
North Carolina</a> (great town!). My mother’s Jewish and I’m kind of a spoiled
<a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=jewish%20american%20princess">Jewish
American Princess</a>.

Cliff: Heh, like <a href="http://spaceballs.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Vespa">Princess Vespa</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>?

Becky: Oh, I love this film, and I love the way she undergoes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis">Catharsis</a>.

+++: Anyway, school was pretty easy for me, and I already finished high school
Math and expected to start studying Mathematics in a local university next
year, when a friend of mine and I ran into a vampire while walking
in downtown Charlotte. He was downright scary, but I tried to be as calm
as possible and ran with my friend into a large diner, where I explained
everything. Luckily for us there were a male slayer and his female watcher
there - a couple.

+++: They took care of the vampire, and after that when we got talking, they
told me that they thought I had a great potential to become a slayer, and I
ended up here.

Chankey: Smashing!

Cliff: OK, OK, God works in mysterious ways - making a brony girl / Miley
Cyrus aficionado into a slayer [cut to Becky, she is smiling and saying
“heh”] and making me, who has practised Martial Arts for years, and is
incredibly athletic (“Buff-y-ed”, heh!) into a freaking warlock.

+++: Anyway, my name is Cliff Farrel, I’m from coastal Florida, and I got
introduced to casting spells by a few local sorcerers and witches. I was
good at it, and they told me I should enrol here and I did. So now I’m
getting to be bossed around by Miss “I’m a J.A.P. and I’m proud of it”
Brony Girl here.

Becky: Listen, for your information, I did some martial arts over in Israel,
when I visited it this summer, and I was told I was pretty good at it, but
more importantly - there’s more to being a good slayer than senselessly
kicking vampires’ ass.

<s id="orientation_day__giles_speech" title="Giles’ Speech">

[Giles is testing the microphone.]

Giles: Mary had a little lamb, little lamb… OK, nice.

+++: All 10th grade students pay attention here. This is Prof. Rupert
Giles and I’m the principal of Sunnydale High School, which as you know
specialises in training slayers, watchers and warlocks-slash-witches to help
battle the world infestation of demons.

+++: Let’s start with a brief history of this school:

+++: Buffy Anne Summers and her mother moved to Sunnydale at 1997 and
she quickly found herself fighting Demons again when being in the 10th grade.
Buffy gathered a small group of friends, who helped her fighting demons
called <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">the Scooby Gang</a>.

+++: During the Scooby Gang’s senior year, a young (about the Scooby
Gang’s members' ages) and insurgent slayer called
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith Lehane</a> comes
to Sunnydale, having been an orphan most of her life, and growing on the
streets. At first, it seems that she has gone to “the dark side of the force”
to quote Buffy, but she ends up preventing the mayor’s ascension in the
last minute and saving the day.

+++: Faith felt sorry for having had sex with <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Alexander_Harris">Mr. Alexander “Xander” Harris</a>
as part of her "double agent" facade for saving Sunnydale, so she offers
him to spend some days hanging out together as friends. Not only do they
fall in love, but Xander is able to defeat her in martial arts fights.

+++: With the encouragement of Buffy and Faith, he becomes more confident,
and eventually makes history by becoming the world’s first known male slayer,
paving the road to future male slayers.

+++: The extended Scooby gang start studying in the local university in
hope of becoming qualified teachers.

+++: Meanwhile, Buffy and her long term friend and loved one,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Angel">Angel</a> are able to convince
the Gypsies who restored his soul to use an even more powerful spell to convert
him back into a human. Angel becomes a slayer as well, and he and Buffy get
married and have children.

+++: In a similar fashion,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Willow_Rosenberg">Willow Rosenberg</a>,
now Dr. Willow Rosenberg, Ph.D, is able to cure her boyfriend,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Daniel_Osbourne">Daniel “Oz”
Osbourne</a>,
out of his werewolfness, he becomes a fellow warlock as well, and the two
marry and have some children. Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Osbourne are both among
the most powerful known wizards in the world today, so you should stay on
their good side.

+++: Not that they abuse their magic. At least not often.

+++: I myself have married Buffy’s mother, who isn’t a qualified demon fighter,
but nevertheless extremely helpful and instrumental to the Scooby Gang.

+++: In the meanwhile,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Principal_Snyder">Principal Snyder</a>
retired, passed the baton to me, and decided to run for mayor of Sunnydale. He
ended up losing the election at first with a large margin, but didn’t give up
and instead offered the newly elected mayor to help him as much as he could.
Snyder proved to be extremely helpful and insightful, and in the second term,
the previous Mayor didn’t run again, and instead supported Mr. Snyder as a
candidate, who won it by a large margin. He is still Sunnydale’s mayor, and a
good friend and supporter of the Scooby gang’s new role as educators and
protectors of Sunnydale, and the world at large.

+++: What all this shows, is like this fine lady [showing
<a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia">Princess Celestia</a> on
the screen and some laughter and enthusiastic claps from the audience]
would say: the real magic is in friendship.

+++: Fast forward to the present, Sunnydale High School has become the
Mecca for training slayers, warlocks and witches, and watchers. We now have
a lot of competition (and some very good one I might add), and it’s hard to
stay on top, but we know better than to ever rest on our laurels. We accept
students from all over the world, and it’s a big melting pot of cultures,
ideas, and knowledge.

+++: The so-called “Web 2.0” revolution did not skip the world of slaying,
and there are now many blogs, wikis, microblogs, forums, chatrooms, and
other online Internet resources about all that. While it’s really exciting,
note, however that you
should be <b>extremely</b> careful: one small mispronunciation on a spell can
kill you or curse you for a long time, which would be much harder, if not
damn right impossible, to revert. Always research your sources, and make sure
that you are safe.

+++: There’s a lot of pseudo-Mystical junk masquerading in today’s world, so
don’t expect the worlds of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a>, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld">Discworld</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina,_the_Teenage_Witch_%28TV_series%29">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a>, or even
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My Little Pony</a> to be 100% accurate. As interesting, enlightening,
and insightful they are, they must be taken with a huge grain of salt.

+++: Thanks to the growing number of demon-fighters, the demon world has been
kept largely at bay for years. However, we try to get ready for a big demonic
calamity, if and when it will happen. Like the Scouts always say: “Be Prepared”.

[Giles drinks some water from his glass.]

Giles: You have been split into teams of three, which consist of a slayer, a
watcher, and a warlock or witch. You should know what your responsibilities
are.

+++: You can pick up the necessary classes from three different times
in your curriculum. We have midterm and final tests but no homework. [Cheers
from the crowd] Once you finish your classes for the day, you are free to
do as you please.

+++: We are also not a vocational school and teach you the proper scholastic
subjects. We are also always open to hear our students’ criticism or question.

+++: I should also note that while we hope you learn a lot from us, then
to paraphrase on what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanina">Rabbi Hanina</a> said
in the Talmud, we will learn much more from you.

+++: Finally note that although you have a lot of responsibility, slaying
is fun and rewarding, so make sure you enjoy it. Your Twelfth-grade mentors
will come to guide you shortly.

[Claps and cheers from the audience.]

[Becky enters the new library of Sunnydale High School. It’s large. The
song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G6QDNC4jPs">“Everytime We Touch”
by Cascada</a> is playing in the background and people are making other light
noises. Becky approaches the librarian, Ms. Chu, who has Oriental looks.]

Becky: Hi, I would have expected a library to be more quiet than that.

Ms. Chu: Yes, but we realised that such sterility is not good for creativity
or for one’s self-esteem. This song actually was a good catalyst for rethinking
our strategy.

+++: Anyway, my name is Diane Chu, and I’m the librarian here. I’m also a
qualified watcher.

Becky: Nice to meet you: I am Becky Shepherd.

Ms. Chu: Nice to meet you. [They shake hands] I think your two team mates are
over there.

Becky: Why, thank you! I’m going to join them.

<s id="becky_in_the_library__chit_chat" title="Chit Chat">

Becky: Hi Chankey, Cliff.

Chankey: Hello, Becky. You were right, I have made many friends.

[Samantha, who is a good looking white girl, approaches Chankey.]

Samantha: Oh, Chankey, there you are! I had a great time tonight. [She
kisses him on the cheek.] We’ll schedule another date using instant
messaging, K? See you!

[She leaves.]

Becky: Ooh... watch it, Mr. Watcher!

[Cliff hits him with his fist.]

Chankey: Heh, tell me about it. What is it about women and Indian men?

Cliff: What is it about women and all exotic men? Or non-exotic ones! Girls
here hit on me like crazy, and I’ve had lots of dates.

Becky: Men do that too, by the way. Like… in Israel, lots of men asked my
female friends and I — where some of them were kinda big, not athletic looking
and not very beautiful — on dates, or hit on us in the typical Israeli “smooth”
way.

+++: That’s not all, but I talked with some female Jewish divorcees, and they
told me that many religious married Jewish asked them if they are interested
to have an affair with them.

Cliff: What? Such an affair? How is this…

Becky: Kosher? It is for married men based on the Jewish Law. Not for
women though.

Cliff: Heh, double standards.

Becky: Well, that’s Judaism for you.

+++: Anyway, Orthodox religious Jews are attracted to ethnic Jewesses
(like me) like flies are attracted to a piece of meat, because we don’t
have to observe for them to have Jewish children. I had many awesome dates
with Yeshivah pupils.

Cliff: That’s great, Brony girl.

Chankey: Cliff, her name is “Becky”.

Becky: That’s quite alright. I like being called “Brony girl”. It makes me
feel special.

+++: So, Cliff [she flicks her hair], what did you do this summer?

Cliff: Oh, I spent this time in southern California, doing martial arts,
witchcraft and hanging around with friends and celebrities.

Becky: Celebrities? Really?!! Which ones?

Cliff: You name it - I met Chuck Norris for example and fought against him.

Becky: You met Chuck Norris? That’s so great! How’s he like? And who won?

Cliff: Oh, he’s great! Keeps saying various aphorisms that I can never tell
if they are from the Bible or not, but, ye know, he’s just being himself.

+++: And he takes losing (like with me - I won two rounds out of three)
amazingly well. Says that he can learn more from a lost fight than from
a fight he’s won.

Becky: Awesome!

+++: Anyway, you probably know that
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Summer
Glau pawns Chuck</a>. She doesn’t have
to hurt you if she doesn’t want to, while Norris kills everyone in sight. It
also takes her a minute to write a rebuttal for a bad blog comment like in
<a href="http://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd: “Venting”</a>, and she would sign it as
him.

[ Chankey bursts out laughing. Cliff and Becky join him. ]

Cliff: Well, I actually met her a few times, including in a fight tournament
where she lost one of the first few rounds. She’s a good fighter, but not
that good. Then she saw me fighting, and asked me if we can fight.

Becky: Summer Glau asked <b>you</b> to fight <b>her</b>? Get out! I’m not
worthy… I’m not worthy… I’m not worthy… [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5FT3IGXtAk">Reference: Wayne's World</a> ]

+++: Cliff, you’re a freaking wizard!

Cliff: I’m a freaking witch! Anyway, I won all three rounds and she told me
it was a good fight.

<s id="becky_in_the_library__with_buffy" title="With Buffy">

Becky: Of course, everyone knows that Buffy is better than Chuck
[<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Buffy/">Buffy
Facts</a>]. He’s been secretly fighting against her, and so far has lost
all of those battles.

Cliff: Yeah, and her gaze can turn Medusa into stone!

Chankey: Buffy Summers is not afraid of demons. Demons are afraid of her, and
for a very good reason.

Buffy’s voice: Buffy Summers is always there when people are spreading
untrue hyperboles about her.

Cliff: Oh, hello Ms. Summers.

[Buffy approaches them from a different aisle in the library.]

Buffy: Hello, kids.

Cliff: By the way, what is your post-marriage name?

Buffy: It’s “Summers”. Angel and I are both called that. He didn’t find his
original family name usable in this day and age, so he adopted mine. His
original name was very aristocratic, and he is actually a direct male
descendent of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>.

Becky: Ooh… so you are now Milady de Summers? Awesome!

Buffy: Heh, well, it is Faith that has an unnatural obsession with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de Winter</a>
— not me.

+++: In any case, for your information, I fought against Chuck Norris several
times and lost all the battles. In fact, that was part of the catalyst that
made us realise that slayers were only humans and that men can be equally as
capable slayers as women. You will hopefully get a chance to meet and even
fight against Mr. Norris sometime throughout the school year.

Becky: I see. So, Ms. Summers, what are you doing here in the library?

Buffy: I’m looking for a book I misplaced.

Becky: About slaying?

Buffy: No, about cooking. A cookbook from the late 60s with a nice spinach,
Broccoli and cheese casserole.

Becky: [Types a few things on the keyboard.] Ms. Summers, I was able to find
a recipe for a casserole like that from that era.

Buffy: Let me see. [Looks] Wow! Looks great. Becky, you've got a lot of
potential as a slayer.

Becky: Why, thank you!

Cliff: Bleh! [He puts his head in his hands.]

Willow: So, do you think I should get a dog?

Buffy: Oh, my friend, Rachel, that software developer chick who moved here,

guys showed interest in her, and she’s been telling me about her exploits with
them endlessly.

Willow: So she has become a slut? So cool!

Faith: Hey! “Slut” is such a 90s term. The new name for that is “polyamorous”!

Buffy: Which just rolls off the tongue.

+++: Heh, to be frank, I don’t think she, ahem…

Faith: Reaches <a href="http://xkcd.com/540/">fourth base</a>?

Buffy: Exactly! With most of them.

[The Scooby Gang (minus Xander and Oz), Becky, Cliff, Chankey, Martha,
Daniel, are sitting at the library of Sunnydale High School.]

Martha: So what you’re saying is that a vampire used this duplicator from
the Q Continuum (like this Star Trek fiction shit) to create copies of himself,
and because of his fucking vampire nature, they didn’t duplicate his freaking
Psyche, and we got… them pseudo-Vampires?

Buffy: Yes, Martha, that’s what we think happened.

Martha: But this Star Trek’s shit ain’t real, right?

Buffy: Not as far as we know, but most people probably think vampires and
demons aren’t real either.

[Xander and Oz enter through a portal.]

Xander: Hey dudes and dudettes. We’re back - let's hope the duplicator is
safe there.

Buffy, Faith, Willow: Hi, Xand! Hi Oz!

Becky: Listen, all of this reminds me of that guy from Freenode - Shlomi Fish…

Other people: who?

Becky: [more slowly] Shlomi Fish - he is an Israeli writer and software
developer. He goes by the name of “Rindolf” on
<a href="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode</a>, because it’s easier for
many non-Hebrew speakers to fathom.

+++: Anyway, he really likes both <i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i> and
“Star Trek: The Next Generation/Deep Space Nine” and created a world,
which he calls the
<a href="http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a>
which crosses them both and where Star Trek is real to a large extent.
He wrote some stories featuring them.

Buffy: Very interesting, maybe we should investigate this. Xander — you handle
it.

Xander: Sure, Becky, we’ll interrogate this Shlomi-slash-Rindolf person in
the cutting edge way of talking with him on IRC.

Martha: Yes, this is some motherfuckin’ crazy-ass shit.

+++: OK, sorry, please brief me about any developments - this is some scary
shit, but I’ve got a morning shift’s tomorrow in my day job.

Daniel: Which is?

Martha: Oh! I’m a part-time secretary and receptionist for an architects’
office.

Daniel: Do you also use such profane language there?

Martha: Oh no, when I’m there I’m always [in a different tone] “Hello there,
sir! Please let me know if you need anything. You’ll find entertainment there,
and we can always chat a little while you are waiting.” and all this shit, but
when I deal with vampires and these shitty pseudo-Vampires, I’m much more at
my hood’s elements.

Daniel: I see - are you single by any chance?

Martha: Yes, Jake and I are just friends and a team, and I’ve only moved
here a few weeks ago.

Daniel: Ah, I see. How about a date then?

Martha: Sure, ah…

Daniel: Daniel! Buffy, Faith, and Willow here also fixed me on a date
with a friend of Buffy’s called Rachel. I’ll have to see which one of
you I like more.

Martha: Oooh… I’ve got competition, baby. Daniel, do you want to split a cab?

Daniel: Yes, I’d like that.

<s id="talk_with_rindolf_on_freenode" title="Talk with “rindolf” on IRC.">

[Becky, Xander, Cliff, and Chankey are all sitting next to their own
computers talking on Freenode with “rindolf” (= Shlomi Fish) in a
channel called “#sunnydale-slayers”]

Becky: [on IRC] rindolf: thanks for agreeing to meet us here, I’m a big fan of
a lot of the stuff on your homepage and elsewhere, but it seems we have a
crisis on our hand, and we need to consult you.

+++: First of all, your stories are fictional, right?

Rindolf: Indeed, but many elements or trends I describe in my stories have a
tendency to materialise after a while in one form or another.

+++: This is despite the fact that they may have appeared unrealistic to some
people who read them at the time.

Becky: OK, there’s something we need to admit: The show Sarah the Vampire
Slayer, actually has a huge grain of truth to it: there are actually real
vampires and demons, and real witches and warlocks with powerful magic, and
I am a slayer trainee.

Rindolf: Heh, sounds farfetched, but like Selina in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><i>Selina
Mandrake</i></a>, I guess I have no choice but to play along.

Becky: Yes, I guess. Anyway, thing is - we ran into a certain artefact from
<a href="http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Selinaverse">the Selinaverse
world</a> which you describe, namely a duplicator that is the property
of the Q Continuum.

Rindolf: How strange!

Becky: Yes, and it was used to duplicate a real vampire into a large number
of pseudo-vampires.

Rindolf: Wow! This sounds like a huge crisis.

Buffy: It sure is.

Rindolf: Well, what do you suggest that we do? Is it my fault?

Buffy: No, it likely isn´t. Just stick in there.

Rindolf: It’s interesting that you say that <i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i>
was partly ingrained in truth. I recall being so in love with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman">Natalie Portman</a>
who was the Alpha Female during the haydays of Web 1.0, and a bit
after that, despite her being underage.

+++: On the other hand, her doing StVS on T.V. in 2002 sort-of terminated her
reign as that, while giving way to Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, Paris
Hilton, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Lawrence (♥!) in roughly that order.

Xander: Oh, don’t get me started on Paris and Miley…

Rindolf: Anyway, these are my two favourite parts from the show:

[

<i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i> featuring Natalie Portman as
Sarah Anne Eisenman, an Ethnic, Reform, Jewish slayer.

Sarah is sitting in a restaurant on a date with Yaakov, a Yeshivah Pupil
from a local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad">Chabad</a> Yeshivah.

]

Sarah: So how's life in the Yeshivah?

Yaakov: Oh, you know, studies, studies and studies.

Sarah: Yes, I know. I need to study as a slayer. And as a high school student
as well.

+++: By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask: what’s the deal with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic">Messianic</a> nature of
Chabad?

Yaakov: Oh that. First of all, it’s a kinda small minority of us, and secondly
it’s kinda rooted in the belief that at any time, every Jew must consider
themselves
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/indiv-nodes/change_the_world.xhtml">the
Messiah</a> and behave accordingly, which will eventually bring the Jewish
people and the world at large to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation">salvation</a> and prosperity.

Sarah: [Thinks for a moment] Hmmm… I can relate to it.

+++: Tell you what, though? I need to go to the bathroom now. You know: girl
things.

Yaakov: Sure, I'll be here waiting for the food.

[Sarah goes to the bathroom and notices a vampires’ couple getting
ready for action. She rushes back to Yaakov.]

Sarah: Hey, Yaakov. Listen, we have a crisis here right now,
and I need you to act like
the Messiah. Can you take your book of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehilim">Tehilim</a> and read from it
when I tell you?

Yaakov: I guess! [He rises up and follows her.]

[They go to meet the vampires.]

Sarah: Now, Yaakov!

[Yaakov starts reciting the Psalms. The vampires are terrified. Sarah
slays them using a stake.]

Sarah: Eat dust, bastards!

Yaakov: Wow! What was that?

Sarah: Vampires! I cannot believe I’ve had to put you through that on our
first date.

Yaakov: That's OK… that’s OK… [scared] I can handle it.

Sarah: It’s over. It’s over. Come let’s return to our table.

[She turns to face him. They look at each other for some seconds and then
start to kiss one another and make out.

They do it for a while until a girl enters from the restaurant, and looks at
them.]

Restaurant Girl: Get a room!

[Sarah and Yaakov smile and go on.]

Sarah Anne Eisenman, an Ethnic, Reform, Jewish slayer.]

Ken: [to Lily] Who are you?

Lily: I’m a nobody.

Ken: [to Sarah] And who are you?

Sarah: I’m Sarah Eisenman. A Jewish vampire slayer. And who are you?

Ken: …Bitch!

[Sarah quickly pokes Ken’s eyes with two of her fingers, and kicks him in the
crotch. He falls to the floor, while agonising in pain.]

Sarah: Yeah, I’m a bitch alright. OK, let’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMCDcKxMVGU">blow this joint</a>.

[She goes, and Lily and the others follow.]

Ken: Hold on, hold on. Well played, Ma’am and frankly, I am miserable here.
I wish there was a way you could help me.

Sarah: Tell you what, Ken? Why not come to the diner, and I’ll pay for your
food and drinks. I’ve been earning quite a lot of cash from tips. You can tell
us stories from this dimension of evil of yours.

[Cut to the diner, Ken is sitting there surrounded by many people who are
listening to his stories.]

Ken: So I told them: “Actually, I have always expected the Spanish Inquisition,
and, on the other hand, they have never expected me.”

[Many members of the audience laugh. Applause.]

Sarah: Ken, would you like some more juice?

Ken: No, Sarah, that's OK, I’m stuffed. Anyway, I think I’ll return to my
dimension of evil now - they will be clueless without me. Thanks for everything.

Sarah: You’re welcome!

[She goes to the counter with Lily.]

Lily: Wow, I earned so much money from tips today. I could totally see myself
working here.

Sarah: Then why don’t you? I earned enough money working here anyway, and now
I’d like to return home.

Lily: Wow, that’s great! Say, can I be Anne now?

Sarah: Lily Anne O’Connor? I guess.

+++: Hold it! The Hebrew equivalent of “Lily” is “Susan” or “Suzanne”, so you
could be Lily Suzanne O’Connor.

Lily: Wow! Awesome.

<s id="rindolf_about_SaVS_freenode_2" title="Rindolf about Sarah the Vampire Slayer">

Rindolf: Yes, one thing I liked is that the characters in SaVS were both
competent and able, and yet not socially or sexually inept, which I felt was
a long-term false dichotomy. I feel it’s a shame that Joss Whedon and
Nat Portman did not get an Emmy for that, even though they were both
nominated for that.

+++: So how come it's based on your life?

Buffy: Well, I originally told Beni, an Israeli fellow who was one of the
show’s creators (and who was a really good
initial student of us) about my life as a slayer, and that I have a feeling
that I have an alter ego / kindred spirit called Sarah who is a liberated
Jewish girl who was a major much coveted “Alpha Female” (as you put it)
at the time. Crazy, right?

Rindolf: Heh, maybe. For what it’s worth, I don’t consider myself a sane
person either.

+++: Anyway, now the question is - if <i>Sarah the Vampire Slayer</i> was to be
remade - who would play her? ;-)

Buffy: What about Natalie again?

Rindolf: Well, the way I see it, she already won the Oscar and is
married-plus, so she’s kinda old school. But what about Jennifer Lawrence?

Cliff: I know! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox">Megan
Fox</a>…♥!

Rindolf: Sounds good. Or maybe Summer Glau…

Cliff: Yes, I met all of them this summer. They are all great people.

Becky: And he fought Glau! And won!

Rindolf: Heh, sounds great.

Xander: Well, let’s get back to business - apparently, we found a duplicator
that is the property of the Q Continuum, and it was able to create a hundred
copies of a precious diamond gold ring. Furthermore, apparently, it was
used to duplicate a vampire into a large number of psycheless-pseudo-vampires
- we captured about four of them but there may be many more.

+++: What can you tell us about the Q Continuum in the Selinaverse?

Rindolf: Oh! Well, the
<a href="http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Q_Continuum_%28Selinaverse%29">Q
Continuum</a> of the Selinaverse is a benevolent guild of organisms which
provides them with some technologically advanced services, including this
duplication that you describe.

Xander: I see. Well, do you know how we can contact this Q Continuum?

Rindolf: Not the slightest - I’m not very good at contacting celebrities or
the men of the administration. I tend to be ignored.

Cliff: Yes, well, I’m pretty good at stuff like that.

Rindolf: Very well, Cliff, please work your magic.

Cliff: Heh, you don’t want to see the real magic that I’m capable of.

Willow: Or mine or Oz’s.

Deborah: Yes, you’re a professor of Computer Science at Sunnydale University,

Deborah: Actually, I do: you’re a witch! You help fight demons. And daddy’s
a warlock!

Willow: Yes, Deborah, you are right. We tried to hide it from you, but I
guess we should not have. We should have been more honest.

Deborah: That’s quite alright, mummy. See, my friend told me his father who
is a Philosophy professor told him that honesty is an active process, and
that honest people were always more dishonest in the past. I forgive you.

Willow: Not if you don’t want to be.

Deborah: Great, because I want to be a [emulating a Scottish accent] postwoman

her phone.]

Faith: OK, here goes.

Faith: How´s that?

Becky: Oh my god! Oh my god! Demonology… martial arts… knife throwing…
history of slaying… Latin… and — American History, English, and Drama.
I need juice. [She flails and sits down.]

Cliff: All in a day’s work, eh, Brony Girl?

Becky: Yeah! I’m busted.

Cliff: Well, at least all this fighting should make you horny.

Becky: I know, I know but no arousal here, Cliff! All I want is to drink
some juice, have a nice warm bath and spend time at the computer. And then
maybe go for a walk.

Chankey: Before you do all that… can you please help me with Physics? I’m
having problems.

Becky: Sure. [Takes a look.] OK, Chankey this is pretty bad. You’re far too
sloppy.

Chankey: Yes, I find dealing with mathematics a big problem. Memorising things
on the other hand - that comes easy due to my photographic memory.

Becky: What have you memorised for example?

Chankey: Well, when I studied for history/etc. tests, I memorised a lot of
material, which I promptly forgot, because I didn’t care enough to remember
it. However, I memorised quite a few texts which are useful for being a watcher
and keep them in my resident memory. These include the grammar rules and
dictionaries of various ancient and contemporary languages, and the holy texts
and mystical materials of various religions

Becky: Wow! I recall hearing that for a long time, every Jewish scholar was
supposed to memorise the whole
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah">Torah</a>,
the Hebrew Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud, etc. by heart. This contributed
to the influence of Judaism, because it enabled their collective heritage
to survive the many destructions in the Old World.

Chankey: Yes, and I have them all memorised and much more.

Cliff: [Sarcastically] One day Chankey here will have the whole English
Wikipedia memorised! Heh.

Chankey: Heh, I'm working on it, Cliff.

<s id="faith-s-childhood" title="Faith reflects upon her childhood">

[Becky and Chankey are sitting in the library, studying together, and
listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZddsmoEsI">Cimorelli
- “When I’m gone”</a> . Faith approaches them.]

Faith: Hmm… hi kids! That doesn’t sound exactly like Anna Kendrick.

+++: Whoa, who are all those girls?

Becky: Oh, they are Cimorelli - six sisters who sing together. They are
a big hit on YouTube.

Faith: Six sisters!

Chankey: And they also have some brothers.

Faith: Heh, God bless their mother. After my third pregnancy (to twins) I
said: “That’s it. No way, José!”.

+++: I would think their being a big family is part of their charm.

Chankey: Yes, and the way I see it: all the power to them. See: I read
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea">20,000
Leagues Under the Sea</a> as a child, and I ended up memorising the English
translation and now the French original, because I liked it so much.

+++: Anyway, Captain Nemo there, thinks he’s a nobody, which is what “Nemo”
means in Latin, but he's not. Thing is: lots of people expressed interest in
him due to his various distinctive qualities, and he kept thinking: “They are
interested in tangential stuff, not in the real me. They don't know the real
me.”

+++: And here's the thing: all these qualities are what make you who you
are, and you should exploit them and be yourself.

Faith: Indeed!

+++: Wish I had any sisters. Or brothers for that matter. But I was my
mother's only child, and my poor excuse for a father was a U.S. Navy sailor
who got drunk along with my mother, they had sex, and the bastard bought
her breakfast the day later, gave her his contact details and left.

+++: They told me it was the only time she ever had sex. [Faith starts
crying.]

+++: When I was 5, my mother was killed by some criminals who spared my life,
and we agreed to pretend that I was also killed. So I grew up on the streets.

+++: Then one day when I was 9, I took the bus to one of my city’s good
neighbourhoods where I saw a young boy about my age about 90% of the way out
of a book.

[Cut to the scene with the young faith and the young boy (= David).]

Faith: Hey homeboy, so this book’s interesting?

David: Hi! Yes, it is.

Faith: [looks at the book] “The Three Musketeers” - think I’ve heard of it.
So it’s good?

David: Yes, it’s great.

Faith: [snatches the book] That book’s mine, bitch!

David: Hey that’s OK - you can have it - I’ll just buy a new one. Bye!

Faith: [from the distance] See ya, homeboy.

Faith’s internal dialogue: It took me a day to finish reading the book. I could
not put it down. The next day, I decided to return it to the boy.

Faith: Hey, bitch, here’s your book back.

David: Thank you…ahem…

Faith: Faith! My name’s "Faith".

David: Nice to meet you - I’m David. I didn’t buy a new book yet.

Faith: That’s good, I suppose. Oh, and they end up killing
Milady de Winter there.

David: Really? I positively love her, she’s amazing.

Faith: Agreed. Well, I’m off to my original hood. [She runs.]

David: Faith… wait!

Faith: Farewell, loser.

[Cut to Faith in the Library.]

Faith: So I Grew up in the streets, learned to slay vampires and other demons,
and — had sex! Lots of lots of sex. I lost track of the number of guys I
seduced, but I still remember each one.

+++: Then I came to Sunnydale, pretended to be evil and ended up saving the
day. I then entered a relationship with Xander, and we got married,
and raised children… not to mention that Peter, the Mafio who killed my
mother and who hasn't killed anyone since, ended up supporting me,
and he also comes to visit me here (and he is close to being a father to me).

+++: But… it’s not the same.

+++: There’s a big hole inside of me… of not having a proper, happy childhood…

+++: I want my daddy! [Bursts out crying harder.]

[Becky walks to her and hugs her.

After a while Faith calms down a little.]

Faith: Oh, look at me: Faith, the fierce vampire slayer, crying like a baby!
I’m so pathetic!

Xander: [From the background of the frame.] Crying does not make you weak.
On the contrary - it’s one way of fighting.

Faith: Hey, honey! You remember Becky and Chankey.

Xander: That I do, Faithy [he hugs her].

[Faith puts her head in Xander’s chest affectionately.]

Becky: Faith, do you know what happened to that boy… David?

Faith: Yes, I do: he found me on the Internet, a few years back, and we
touched base. He’s happily married plus children and is an expert
of Internet marketing and e-Commerce. He came to visit me in Sunnydale,
and brought his children with him, and mine got along very nicely with his.

+++: He brought the copy of <i>The Three Musketeers</i> that I stole
and returned, and asked me if I wanted it. I had my own book that I bought
after I came to Sunnydale, but was excited to see the copy in question.

+++: And finally, he also told me that at the time, his father
had been in touch with some couples who were looking to adopt children
my age, and they would have been able to find a couple that could have
adopted me.

Becky: Oh! [She has tears in her eyes.]

Faith: Yes, well, that's all over now I guess.

<s id="prospects-of-fighting-the-pseudo-vampires" title="Prospects of fighting the Pseudo-Vampires">

[Becky, Cliff, and Chankey are sitting in the library, studying together, and
Faith is approaching.]

Becky: Hey, Faith! Are there any news with respect to handling the Pseudo-vampires
crisis?

Faith: Hi Becky! Well we have some plans and <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/First_Evil">The First</a> told us we'll likely
be lucky enough.

Becky: Isn't The First being Evil?

Faith: Not anymore - during one divination we made him convert to the good side.
He realised that being alone for milliards of years does not justify being frustrated
for the rest.

Becky: Heh, he kinda reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> .

Faith: Oh, The First is totally psyched about Marvin. He sees him as his soul mate
and as someone who shares a similar past. In fact, during many divinations, he recites
poems he had written about Marvin and himself. Very emo ones, but they make
people laugh, and The First does not seem to mind that.

Becky: Hey, I also told my older brother, who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army">U.S. Army</a> soldier about the crisis and he surprisingly didn't think I was delusional, and said he may be able to help us.

Faith: Good job, Beck! You have a lot of potential.

Cliff: Oh, for goodness sake! How much potential can one brony-chick sport?

Becky: by the way, how did you survive on the streets as a girl?

Faith: well, "living on the streets" is kind-of a stretch. See: I took Peter
the Mafio's advice and collected money from people in exchange for stand-up
comedy/philosophy sessions and earned my keeps this way. Just for the record,
being original is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kQCpsPnnew">a Big
Mistake</a>; I crossoverred stuff all over the place.

+++: And after I became a slayer: big money! People will give you
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther">half</a>
their life savings for saving their lives. I settled on a
quarter at most, heh.

+++: Then after I hit puberty, I used to seduce guys all over the place. And I was below the age of consent so it was fucking illegal!

Chankey: Fucking illegal fucking!

[They laugh.]

Becky: Chankey: you've just said the F-word… I knew you had a lot of potential.

Chankey: thanks, Becky! I try.

Cliff: God, kill me now!

Faith: anyway, many of my lovers came for more helpings, and surprisingly
they never coincided. And there was passion alright. Despite the fact that
I did that only to compensate for my mother.

+++: but there was something strange: I used to have these dreams where I
had sex with one or more lover <b>and</b> one or more characters from
TV shows, films, or books. And I never had a ménage in my life, and you
know how dreams during which you have sex are supposed to be good dreams…
these dreams were nightmares!

Chankey: strange…

Faith: yes! And after the sex, I saw myself standing in front of my own
lookalike, who said "You <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml">know</a>, but you don't know enough."

+++: and… after I came to Sunnydale, I had sex with Xander as part of my master
plan for preventing the Ascension, and I felt sorry for him being manipulated
like that. So I ended up hanging out with him for a few days. I wouldn't have
admitted it back then, but I fell in love with him.

+++: Then I had a dream where we were kissing each other passionately and
that time, it was a very pleasant one. And then I saw my lookalike, and she
said: “Now you know more. Keep it up. By the way, my name's
<a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Eliza_Dushku">Eliza</a>.”

+++: And I never saw her again.

Cliff: That's weird!

Faith: Yes. Anyway, I taught Xand some martial arts, and surprisingly,
he was able to defeat both Buffy and me quite often. We thought it may have
to do with our emotional attachment, so we asked Chuck Norris to fight us and
he agreed and won too. (He likely thought it was weird that two frail girls
asked him that, heh.)

+++: So we had to rethink our prejudice against men being slayers…

Buffy: My… kindred… spirit! [She faints into Xander’s arms.]

SMG: OK, we have no time to lose. [Presses something on her smartphone.]
OK, General, your men can come now. And bring a doctor for Buffy - she fainted.

General Thompson: OK, men, prepare for phase 1. There are around one hundred
thousand targets around. Deploy the robots, and be careful.

[The soldiers deploy the robots who attack and kill the pseudo-vampires.]

Pseudo-vampires: Let's go up.

+++: Let's not go up.

+++: Let's get down. [Gets killed by an arrow.]

[The pseudo vampires all go to the outside.]

General Thompson: OK, now let's get them out of town. Prepare for Phase 2.

Voices from the radio: Affirmative sir.

[Buffy wakes up.]

Buffy: Oh, ow, ow, ow. [Looks at SMG] Sarah! [Sees the command vehicle] What’s
going on there?

SMG: Fourth division of the U.S. Army - received basic training in slaying,
and now they are hopefully going to kick the ass of these pseudo-vampires.

Buffy: Really? I wasn’t aware that the U.S. Army trained in slaying.

Soldier: Yes, well, we can keep secrets better than you.

[The soldiers are scaring the Pseudo-Vampires into the field outside Sunnydale,
while still shouting “Hail Buffy”.]

General Thompson: Excellent men, things are going according to plan. Now,
deploy the helicopters for what is hopefully the last phase.

[The Helicopters fly over the PVs and spread oil across.]

Pseudo-vampires: om num num… olive oil.

A different helicopter approaches and a soldier lights a flare using a
match and drops it on the Pseudo-Vampires. They cry as they all burst
in flame and become dust.

Mark crumbling.

Becky: Oh my God!

Cliff: Good timing on my part - now I’ll need to recharge this Mana amulet.

Faith: Good call, Cliff! You’ve got a lot of potential too.

Cliff: Thank you, Ms. Harris. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/princess_bride/quotes/">I won’t let it go to my head</a>.

+++: Anyway, my spell was about friends, so how come this vampire is a friend.

General Thompson: Oh! Mark Raymond here used to be a contractor for us back
when the Q Continuum of the Selinaverse expanded into our own world, which
we’ll now call the
<a href="http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Beckyverse">Beckyverse</a> [cut
to Becky - she is blushing] and experimented with a duplicator that they
had given us when he became a vampire, stole it, and caused all this trouble.

Willow: So we’ll have to restore his soul, and them convert him back into
a human? God! That will require some powerful spells and be very time
consuming. I’ll have to research it.

[Voice from behind of <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Enyos_of_the_Kalderash">Enyos of the Kalderash</a>]

Enyos: It will take us about two hours.

[ Willow turns around. ]

Willow: Enyos! Nice to see you again! [they hug.]

[Enyos also hugs Buffy and shakes the hands of some of the men.]

Willow: Two hours? Really? How?

Enyos: Well, we got better with it due to practice. See: following the
restoration of Angel here, we figured out we can do the same with other
vampires and made a big business out of it.

Willow: So how much will all this cost?

Enyos: Special offer for you today at half the price: zero dollars.

Buffy: Zero?

Enyos: Yes! Our business model is different. First of all, we ask
the transformed vampires to provide us with a subset of their income as
benevolent humans - as much or as little as they want - as a token of their
appreciation.

+++: And furthermore, we also use their stories of their lives as vampires
as inspiration and fodder for our own franchise of vampire fiction. Some really
sick stuff there, but they sell like hotcakes.

Willow: Lovely! That sounds like an exciting and innovative take on slaying.

Enyos: Oh, it certainly is. And we’re willing to share our knowledge and
experience with you. For the right consulting price.

[Meanwhile, they are already back in Sunnydale.]

Becky: Awesome! Sounds really cool.

Buffy: Alright! Oz, Giles, you escort Mark to Enyos’ clan back in Europe, and
learn as much as you can from them about it - we can negotiate a consulting
price later on.

+++: The rest of us need to start the Sunnydale de-evacuation.

Snyder: Hey there, Buffy. I’m glad it all worked out in the end. We’re thinking
of doing one of our famous “open commerce days” where shops and food and drinks
outlets sell goods for as little or as much as the buyer is willing to pay.
General, your men are welcome to join the party here as well.

General Thompson: Thank you, Mayor! We’d love that.

[

Faith sees a middle-aged man (Richard) who is moderately fat, and balding,
and resembles her.

Richard: Hello, Faith.

Faith: Hi, who are you?

General Thompson: Faith, this is your biological father, former
U.S. Navy Cmdr. Richard Hoffer. We traced him, and DNA tests confirm that he
is your father.

Richard: Faith!… I worked as an Electrical and Mechanical technician in the
Navy - doing maintenance and fixing equipment that broke. I was good at it and
took my job seriously, but was never much of a combat fighter.

+++: Anyway, during shore leaves I had the unfortunate habit of drinking and
ending up waking the next morning with a hangover and a woman by my side,
whom I always ended up buying breakfast and leaving my contact details.
They were all happy to correspond with me, except one - your mother.

Faith: Oh… [She starts crying.]

Richard: Anyway, I ended up trying to trace the whereabouts of your mother,
and was told she and her daughter were killed by criminals.

Faith: My reported death was a cover story… [She Continues to cry.]

Richard: Yes. Something died in me inside that moment, and I stopped drinking
after that.

Faith: I don’t drink either…

Richard: Anyway, I heard you saved the world several times. I was told you
are a slayer, who helps fight demons. I didn’t witness that first hand, but
I heard enough stories so I believe that is the case.

+++: But I guess it’s true that the apple sometimes completely supplants
the tree.

Faith: I’m sure you are a great warrior too. [She
moves towards Richard and they hug each other.]

[They remain hugging for a while.]

Faith: Dad, your belly is so soft.

Richard: OK, now that that’s behind us, I should admit that I ended up marrying
a very nice lady (her name is Gabrielle) and we have two children — a boy
and a girl. They are here and want to meet you.

Faith: I’d love that. I think mine are sound asleep now being relieved, but
Xander, that’s how we refer to my husband, Alexander Harris, will be happy
to tag along and meet your family. I think we can grab some burgers and
icecream.

Richard: Sure, that’ll be great. Open commerce day…

Buffy: Why hello there. Mr. Q, I presume.

Q: Hello, Ms. Summers. [Mechanically] You look nice.

Buffy: Why thank you, Mr. Q [she flicks her hair.]

Q: OK, let's get straight to business. The Q continuum of the Selinaverse
has been expanding its coverage and influence, into the Beckyverse. Using
our advanced technology which is still working here, we've discovered similar
benevolent continuums to us here, only mixing and matching technology with
magic (which won't continue to work in the Selinaverse), and many good spirits
and demons.

+++: Anyway, we are seeking a volunteer to act as the ambassador of the
Beckyverse's Milky Way's Galaxy's Earth planet in the Q Continuum.

Buffy: Awesome! Angel, dear, how about you? You're one of the oldest living
Beckyverse Terrans.

Angel: I guess. Sure, I’m game.

Q: Done then. Angel, you can now open a gateway to everywhere in the Beckyverse
or the Selinaverse. Try not to abuse this power: great power requires great
responsibility.

Angel: Sure, Mr. Q. [ They shake hands. ]

Deborah: Hi, Angel! My name is Deborah and I am the ambassador of the Earth
of the Selinaverse in the Q Continuum, of well, the Selinaverse as well. You
and I should work together.

+++: The first order of business is probably to return the Duplicator back
to our possession. If you need anything duplicated by us, you can use our
duplication-as-a-service, but I suppose your world is not ready for your
own duplicator.

Angel: Sure, let’s head over to the National Treasury and return it.

Deborah: OK, then we can sit over a drink and update one another with “intel”
— Q here will join us.

Angel: Nice to meet you, Mr. Q. You look dashing as always with your Star
Fleet uniform.

<s id="SMG_and_Buffy" title="SMG and Buffy Chatting">

[SMG and Buffy are sitting in a restaurant chatting.]

Buffy: So, how’s life in the Selinaverse?

SMG: Oh, it’s great! We have milliard years old talking and sentient cats
who converted to Judaism; I have Moses, King David, Aristotle,
Socrates, Q, and Kai Winn on my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin_%28software%29">Pidgin</a>’s
contact list; I can travel to Bajor, the Klingon home world, or the
planet <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vulcan">Vulcan</a>, and
the Q Continuum has some positively awesome scholars.

+++: But like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">sword
of Damocles</a> story goes, we live under constant threat from the
advanced technology that we, our friends and our enemies possess. It’s
a risk we have to take as characters inside a fictional world.

Buffy: Interesting. By the way, how is
<a href="http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Selina_Mandrake">Selina</a>
there doing?

SMG: She is doing fine, given the fact that she is the most famous college
student on the planet now, and the origin of our entire fictional
universe’s name. Actually,
<a href="http://stexpanded.wikia.com/wiki/Katie_Jacobson">Katie Jacobson</a>
kinda pretends to resent her for our world not being called the “Katieverse”.
Selina ended up co-authoring a screenplay along with our Shlomi Fish which she
swears is based on what really happened to her. Then she got
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html#selina">Emma
Watson</a> to play her, co-starring with
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html#the-guide">Wil
Wheaton</a> as “The Guide”.

Buffy: Wow! You have an Emma Watson too? Does she also charge an arm and a leg
for her films there?

SMG: Yes! And they found a studio which was able to afford her. The film
has been highly acclaimed and received many nominations.

Buffy: I see. Here, Shlomi Fish’s screenplays are still quite obscure.

SMG: Ah, that’s a shame.

Buffy: Yes, he told us he’s working a lot on
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/2c1fue/the_importance_of_human_networking/">publicity
and human networking</a> so that may change soon.

[Buffy’s phone rings.]

Buffy: [To the phone.] Hi! Sweetie? You could not sleep? That’s quite alright,
come here - you have my location on the phone.

+++: [To SMG] So you were the Alpha female of the Web 1.0 area?

SMG: Yes! Having starred in the show
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer">Buffy
the Vampire Slayer</a> starting from 1997. But - Sic Transit Gloria Mundi.
Not sure if anyone remembers me now, and Jennifer (Lawrence!) and I joke that
one day she’ll write her autobiography with the subtitle of “You used to
be Sarah Michelle Who??”. [ <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/image-macros/indiv-nodes/sic_transit_gloria_jenn_law.xhtml">Reference</a> ]

Buffy: [Bursts out laughing.] Yes, seems like the Web 2.0 and Open Content
Revolution is drawing to a mostly successful conclusion and now it’s time
for a new revolution.

SMG: And I’m asking myself
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/SummerNSA/A-SummerNSA-Reading/A-hashtag-SummerNSA-s-Reading/index.html#about">“So, who the Hell is Qoheleth?”</a>
— or in plain English, who are the current
and future Hacker Monarchs? I personally intend to be one of those.

[Buffy’s daughter, Miranda, arrives, looks at SMG and Buffy and runs towards
Buffy and hugs her.]

Miranda: I Love You, Mummy. Say, who is this lady who kinda looks like you?

Buffy: Ah, that’s your Aunt Sarah. It’s a long story, if you’ll ever be
interested to hear it.

Miranda: Oh, Mummy - I would.

+++: [To SMG] Hi Aunt Sarah! Nice to meet you.

SMG: Nice to meet you too, eh…

Miranda: Miranda Michelle Summers!

SMG: Miranda Michelle! Nice to meet you.
