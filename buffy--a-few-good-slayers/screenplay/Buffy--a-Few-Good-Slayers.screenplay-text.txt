[Buffy: a Few Good Slayers

Tagline: I learned more from my students than I have from my teachers.

Note: This screenplay was written by
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and
is original artwork.]


[Abstract: after Faith turns out to have been a benevolent slayer after
all, and prevented the Mayor's ascension in the last minute, She joins forces
with Buffy and <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby
Gang</a>, as an equal co-slayer.

In September 2014 when the story begins, there are male and female slayers,
witches, and watchers, and Sunnydale was transformed into the Mecca of the
demon-fighting world with the Scooby Gang now teaching many classes of demon
fighters. They are also almost all happily married and have young
children.

The future looks bright for the demon fighting world as Rebecca “Becky”
Shepherd, a slayer wannabe in the 10th grade as well as Chankey Rajeesh (an
Englishman of Indian descent, with photographic memory, who wishes to become a
watcher) and Cliff Farrel (an all-American, extremely athletic,
warlock/witch-wannabe) become a team, and start studying.

First few chords of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA">Miley
Cyrus’ “Party In The U.S.A”</a>. Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd is shown
walking in the high school lobby listening to the song playing from her
smartphone that is tucked on her belt. She is wearing a

Little Pony: Frienship is Magic</a> shirt, and has a name tag that reads
"Rebecca Shepherd \[Slayer\]".
]

Cliff: Yo, brony girl - stop!

Becky: Hey, sorry for not paying attention [she turns off the music]. What’s
up?

Cliff: Chankey here [points at Chankey] and I are looking for a slayer to
complete our team. You don't seem exactly like slayer-material, but since
all the other slayers we talked with were taken , I guess we should settle
on you.

[Becky smiles.]

Becky: sure, I'd love to be team with you. Let's register.

[She uses her smartphone to register.]

Becky: OK, done.

Chankey: [in an English accent] Smashing!

Becky: Chankey, is it? Are you British?

Chankey: Yes, Miss Shepherd.

Becky: “Becky” please.

Chankey: Yes, well, I am off Indian descent and carry an Indian name. I have
photographic memory, and did extremely well in my studies. I was supposed to
start studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow
School</a> (the notorious public school, or what you Americans will call a
private school) because I had many friends there, but then became aware
of some demonic activity in Greater London, and was indoctrinated as a
watcher-wannabe here.

+++: I don't have any friends here.

Becky: [Grabbing his hand.] I'm sure you’ll make some.

Chankey: Yes.

+++: So what about you? What’s your story?

Becky: Well, I grew up and lived in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina">Charlotte,
North Carolina</a> (great town!). My mother’s Jewish and I’m kind of a spoiled
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jewish%20american%20princess">Jewish
American Princess</a>.

Cliff: Heh, like Princess Vespa in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>?

Becky: Oh, I love this film, and I love the way she undergoes a Catharsis.

+++: Anyway, school was pretty easy for me, and I already finished high school
Math and expected to start studing Mathematics in a local university next
year, when a friend of mine and I ran into a vampire while walking with my
friend in downtown Charlotte. He was downright scary, but I tried to be as calm
as possible and ran with her into a large diner, where I explained everything.
Luckily for us there were a male slayer and his female watcher there - a couple.

+++: They took care of the vampire, and after that when we got talking, they
told me that they tought I had a great potential to become a slayer, and I
ended up here.

Chankey: Smashing!

Cliff: OK, OK, God works in mysterious ways - making a brony girl / Miley
Cyrus afficiando into a slayer [cut to Becky, she is smiling and saying
“heh”] and making me, who has practised Martial Arts for years, and is
incredibly athletic (“Buff-y-ied”, heh!) into a freaking warlock.

+++: anyway, my name is Cliff Farrel, I'm from coastal Florida, and I got
introduced to casting spells by a few local sorcerers and witches. I was
good at it, and they told me I should enroll here and I did. So now I'm
getting to be bossed around by Miss “I’m a J.A.P. and I’m proud of it”
Brony Girl here.

Becky: Listen, for your information, I did some martial arts over in Israel,
when I visited it this summer, and I was told I was pretty good at it, but
more importantly - there’s more to being a good slayer than senselessly
kicking vampires’ ass.

<s id="orientation_day__giles_speech" title="Giles’ Speech">

[Giles is testing the microphone.]

Giles: Mary had a little lamb, little lamb… OK, nice.

+++: all 10th grade students pay attention here. This is Prof. Rupert
Giles and I’m the principal of Sunnydale High School, which as you know
specialises in training slayers, watchers and warlocks-slash-witches to help
battle the world infestation of demons.

+++: Let's start with a brief history of this school:

+++: Buffy Anne Summers and her mother moved to Sunnydale at 1997 and
she quickly found herself fighting Demons again when being in the 10th grade.
Buffy gathered a small group of friends, who helped her fighting demons
called the Scooby Gang.

+++: During the Scooby Gang’s senior year, a young (three years the Scooby
Gang’s junior) and insurgent slayer called
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith Lehane</a> comes
to Sunnydale, having been an orphan most of her life, and growing on the
streets. At first, it seems that she has gone to “the dark side of the force”
to quote Buffy, but she ends up preventing the mayor’s ascension in the
last minute and saving the day.

+++: Faith is adopted by a local couple, starts studying as a 10th grader in
the high school, and joins forces with Buffy as a co-slayer. She maintains
a relationship with Mr.
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Alexander_Harris">Alexander “Xander” Harris</a> that grows from being primarily sexual, to friendship, to deep love, and
they remain faithful to each other to this very day. Pun not intended.

+++: With the encouragement of Buffy and Faith, Xander becomes more confident,
and eventually makes history by becoming the world’s first known male slayer,
paving the road to future male slayers.

+++: Meanwhile, Buffy and her long term friend and loved one,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Angel">Angel</a> are able to convince
the Gypsies who restored his soul to use an even more powerful spell to convert
him back to a human. Angel becomes a slayer as well, and he and Buffy get
married and have children.

+++: In a similar fashion,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Willow_Rosenberg">Willow Rosenberg</a> (
now Dr. Willow Rosenberg, Ph.D) is able to cure her boyfriend
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Daniel_Osbourne">Daniel “Oz” Osbourne</a>)
out of his werewolfness, he becomes a fellow warlock as well, and the two
marry and have some children. Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Osbourne are both among
the most powerful known wizards in the world today, so you should stay on
their good side.

+++: Not that they abuse their magic. At least not often.

+++: I myself have married Buffy’s mother, who isn’t a qualified demon fighter,
but nevertheless extremely helpful and instrumental to the Scooby Gang.

+++: In the meanwhile,
<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Principal_Snyder">Principal Snyder</a>
retired, passed the baton to me, and decided to run for mayor of Sunnydale. He
ended up losing the election at first with a large margin, but didn't give up
and instead offered the newly elected mayor to help him as much as he could.
Snyder proved to be extremely helpful and insightful, and in the second term,
the previous Mayor, didn’t run again, and instead supported Mr. Snyder election,
who won it by a large margin, and is still Sunnydale’s mayor, and a good friend
and supporter of the Scooby gang's new role as educators and protectors of
Sunnydale, and the world at large.

+++: What all this shows is like this fine lady would say: [showing
<a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia">Princess Celestia</a> on
the screen and some laughter and enthusiastic claps from the audience]
“The real magic is in friendship”.
