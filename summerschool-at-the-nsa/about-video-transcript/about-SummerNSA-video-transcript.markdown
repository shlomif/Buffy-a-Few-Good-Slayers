Hi all,

in this video, I will tell the story of how I came to write the
screenplay “Summerschool at the NSA” which can be viewed online
here:

http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/

I first learned of the NSA in the film Sneakers ( 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_%281992_film%29 ), which I watched in
high school and enjoyed, where the NSA plays an unflattering role.

Shortly after high school, I was employed for several workplaces and then
during 1997 joined the Technion. 1996 was when the Internet and the Web 1.0
craze started, and everone and their mother were looking for good tech workers.
Moreover, shortly after that, the show Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer ) and became a big hit,
and many people became obsessd with it, and many Web 1.0 fan sites of the show,
and its lead actress, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar ,
sprang like mushrooms after the rain.

Now, Gellar’s first foray into the cinema was in the films I Know What You
did Last Summer, and Scream 2, which were cheesy and not so scary horror films,
which although successful, received negative critical reception.

During the summer of 1998, I was discussing the shortage of capable technical
workers in the software industry over E-mail with my friend, Omer Zak, when this
quote appeared:

I told Omer: «Even the NSA doesn’t have enough programmers. But it is not
likely that they will have more, and that’s because Summerschool at the NSA
may might as well be the name of Sarah Michelle Gellar’s next movie.

To which he replied: «And as opposed to I Know What You Did Last Summer,
it is going to be scary.»

This quote together with some other influences, such as the fact that I worked
on a Friends/Fountainhead crossover at http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/
triggered a long period of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania which made me
do some really crazy things, and also made the name “Sarah Michelle Gellar”
trigger some unfortunate feelings for a long time.

In any case, after I mostly recovered from the mania, I continued to write
stories and screenplays as part of my creative process, and ended up reaching
better conclusions about life, love, beauty, competence, and honesty through
them, and in general - as part of my therapy.

Anyway, many years later I showed the original joke to my friend “kilmo” who
is a cryptologist and he commented as
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=kilmo-about-the-NSA 
where he said:

««

Why would you like to make fun of the crypto world ? ;) The NSA
does know what you did last summer. And by putting this on the web, they
know that you know. Which may lead to interesting philosophical issues.

»»

I noted down the quote and let it rest for a long while until following some
inspiration from the Chuck Norris factoids meme, I started to collect
factoids deprecating the NSA:

http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/

Some sample ones are:

««

* The NSA don’t publish. They perish. 

* The Bajoran scholars have positively identified
Benjamin Sisko as The Emissary. They also positively
identified the NSA headquarters as The Dungeon. 

* One of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s episodes took place 
in the NSA headquarters, but had to be destroyed, because
all of the test audience had uncontrollable panic attacks. 

* The NSA knows what you did last summer. But no one, in
the NSA or outside it, knows why they should.
