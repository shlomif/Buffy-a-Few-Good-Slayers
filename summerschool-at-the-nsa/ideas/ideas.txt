    - this joke:
        - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=the-cia-vs-the-kgb-vs-the-shin-bet

* SGlau and convincing people that she got clearance.

* The patrol guard with the vicious dog:
    - he memorised Spaceballs, Monty Python & The Holy Grail, and
        their Life of Brian and goes over them time and again for entertainment
        during guarding.
    - SGlau recommend The Princess Bride too.
