* SGlau and convincing people that she got clearance.

* The patrol guard with the vicious dog:

        - they hug and SGlau sheds a few tears.

* SGlau returns to the NSA building and calls a conference.

        resources.

            - "Amateuristic stuff often works best."
        - He says that there's no way a Hollywood actress could have gotten
        clearnace.
        - SGlau tells him that the media will make a very big deal out of it:
            - "Summer schools the NSA"
            - "NSA : Summer-schooled"
            - "The NSA: Terminated"
        - He says that his life is over.
        - SGlau: "don't you want to know who the architects of me coming here
        were?"
        - Better sit down.
        - SGlau: "Sarah. Michelle. Gellar."
            - NSA head: "No!!! I knew it. I knew that… that… woman was Satan.
            How dare she? Death would be better than this."
                - starts sobbing.

* The NSA chief tells the story about SMG :
    - several young people arrived for internship during the summer of 1997.
    - SMG starred in Buffy, and became an instant role model and object
    of affection among youth (and some older people) and also made her first
    major and notable film debuts in such films as
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer and
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_2
    which were cheesy and not-so-scary horror films.
    - It became a meme among the interns that “If 'Summerschool at the NSA'
    was SMG’s next film, it would have been scary.”
        - most interns left citing this.
    - It continued to haunt the NSA.
    - Meme appears on the Internet:
        - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#smg_next_film
    - The NSA hires a PI to monitor SMG:
        - seems to lead an ordinary life of:
            - filming.
            - modelling.
            - eating.
            - training.
            - sleeping.
            - dating.
            - socialising.
        - decide that she is not a threat.
    - SGlau asks what the NSA did wrong in allowing such a huge breach of
    their “security” by her?

            - Publish or Perish = Life or Death
    - SGlau and the NSA chief leave to take his wife on a date - first time
    for many years, with SGlau there.
        - "Class dismissed".
        - applause.
    - End credits.
