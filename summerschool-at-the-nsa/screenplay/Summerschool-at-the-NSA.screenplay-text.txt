<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

[Note: This screenplay was written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and is original artwork.]

[Mr. Fish would like to apologise to the real-life and living
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar">Ms.
Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> (abbreviated as SMG) and to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau">Ms. Summer Glau</a>
(abbreviated as SGlau), who are featured in this story as themselves, if he
has misrepesented them.]

[Abstract: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau conspire to take the United
States National Security Agency (NSA) out of the equation. See how they
succeed. This is surrealistic realism, but can actually happen.]

[Black screen, SMG’s voice, while emulating her daughter.]

SMG: Humpty dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty dumpty had a great fall. And all the
King's horses, and all the King's men could not put Humpty together again.

[Screen showing SGlau laughing. SMG and she are sitting at a diner together.]

SGlau: [stops laughing] oh my God, Sarah, your daughter’s so smart.

SMG: and… funny.

SGlau: yes. Well, except for Mother Goose, what does she like?

SMG: oh she loves <i>My Little Pony</i>. She and I watch it almost every week
together.

SGlau: wow, you're also a pega-sister?

SMG: I'm not addicted to <i>My Little Pony</i>. I swear! I can quit any time.
Just let me watch one… more… episode. [giggles]

SGlau: hah, hah. For your information, my My Little Pony addicts support group
meets every second and fourth Saturday of the month, and I am currently at step
five of our twelve step program.

SMG: sounds like a plan. I'll consider joining.

SGlau: cool, heh.

+++: anyway, why did you schedule meeting me here?

SMG: OK, let's get straight to business. Summer: I’d like to hire you to star
in my latest production: <i>Sarah Michelle Gellar‘s Summerschool at the NSA</i>
where you will help finish off an old and pesky nemesis of mine.

SGlau: NSA as in the National Security Agency?

SMG: yes, these very ones.

SGlau: sounds really crazy, Sarah. Are you sure you're OK?

SMG: No, I'm not. My secret for success was that I was never completely sane,
heh.

SGlau: [Uses her smartphone] Hmmm… I see DuckDuckGo
has some hits for “Summerschool at the NSA” and your name, hmm... and some
NSA factoids. Hah! “The NSA does not publish, they perish”, “The NSA knows
what you did last summer, but no one, inside the NSA or outside it, knows why
they should”.

SMG: these factoids would have been funnier, if they had not been so true.

SGlau: yes, I see.

+++: so? Assuming it is something sane enough, which I doubt, why do you need
me to do it?

SMG: well, see, if I were still 18, and a happy spinster, then I would do it
myself, but now…

SGlau: you are married and have children.

SMG: exactly, I cannot really tell my daughter: “Hi Baby, mummy is going to
enter the Lion’s den.”…

SGlau: or what the Bajoran scholars positively identified as “The Dungeon”.

SMG: exactly. She would kill me if I did that.

SGlau: hah, hah. I can imagine the headline: “Sarah Michelle Gellar who played
Buffy the vampire slayer, murdered in cold blood by child daughter.”

SMG: [giggles] indeed, the Apple does not fall too far from the tree.

SGlau: the Apple completely supplanted the tree. The golem has risen upon its
master.

SMG: [thoughtfully] yes.

SGlau: well, I don’t suppose she will murder you literally. You know,
<a href="http://xkcd.com/725/">xkcd #725</a>.

SMG: well, one thing I can tell you about parenthood is that such things
can progress from figurative to literal, very quickly.

[SGlau laughs.

A waitress arrives. ]

Waitress: hi, hope you are having a good time. What can I get you?

SMG: OK, I'll have some peach infusion, and bring us a jug of water with two
glasses.

SGlau: [stops laughing] I'll have some Lipton orange tea, and can you also
bring a small plate of cookies?

Waitress: sure [takes the menus]. By the way, what are you doing here?

SMG: [looks amusingly at SGlau] We’re scheming.

SGlau: yes, we are conspiring.

[They both burst out laughing.]

Waitress: OK… [looks puzzled] your order should arrive shortly.
