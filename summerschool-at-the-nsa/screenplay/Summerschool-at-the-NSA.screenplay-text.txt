<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

[Note: This screenplay was written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and is original artwork.]

[Mr. Fish would like to apologise to the real-life and living
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar">Ms.
Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> (abbreviated as SMG) and to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau">Ms. Summer Glau</a>
(abbreviated as SGlau), who are featured in this story as themselves, if he
has misrepesented them.]

[Abstract: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau conspire to take the United
States National Security Agency (NSA) out of the equation. See how they
succeed. This is surrealistic realism, but can actually happen.]

[Black screen, SMG’s voice, while emulating her daughter.]

SMG: Humpty dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty dumpty had a great fall. And all the
King's horses, and all the King's men could not put Humpty together again.

[Screen showing SGlau laughing. SMG and she are sitting at a diner together.]

SGlau: [stops laughing] oh my God, Sarah, your daughter’s so smart.

SMG: and… funny.

SGlau: yes. Well, except for Mother Goose, what does she like?

SMG: oh she loves <i>My Little Pony</i>. She and I watch it almost every week
together.

SGlau: wow, you're also a pega-sister?

SMG: I'm not addicted to <i>My Little Pony</i>. I swear! I can quit any time.
Just let me watch one… more… episode. [giggles]

SGlau: hah, hah. For your information, my My Little Pony addicts support group
meets every second and fourth Saturday of the month, and I am currently at step
five of our twelve step program.

SMG: sounds like a plan. I'll consider joining.

SGlau: cool, heh.

+++: anyway, why did you schedule meeting me here?

SMG: OK, let's get straight to business. Summer: I’d like to hire you to star
in my latest production: <i>Sarah Michelle Gellar‘s Summerschool at the NSA</i>
where you will help finish off an old and pesky nemesis of mine.

SGlau: NSA as in the National Security Agency?

SMG: yes, these very ones.

SGlau: sounds really crazy, Sarah. Are you sure you're OK?

SMG: No, I'm not. My secret for success was that I was never completely sane,
heh.

SGlau: [Uses her smartphone] Hmmm… I see DuckDuckGo
has some hits for “Summerschool at the NSA” and your name, hmm... and some
NSA factoids. Hah! “The NSA does not publish, they perish”, “The NSA knows
what you did last summer, but no one inside the NSA or outside it knows why
they should”.

SMG: these factoids would have been funnier if they were not so true.

SGlau: yes, I see.
