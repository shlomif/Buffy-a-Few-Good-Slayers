<s id="about" title="About this screenplay">

[Note: This screenplay was written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and is original artwork.]

[Mr. Fish would like to apologise to the real-life and living
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar">Ms.
Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> (abbreviated as SMG) and to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau">Ms. Summer Glau</a>
(abbreviated as SGlau), who are featured in this story as themselves, if he
has misrepesented them.]

[Abstract: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau conspire to take the United
States National Security Agency (NSA) out of the equation. See how they
succeed. This is surrealistic realism, but can actually happen.]

[Black screen, SMG’s voice, while emulating her daughter.]

SMG: Humpty dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty dumpty had a great fall. And all the
King's horses, and all the King's men could not put Humpty together again.

[Screen showing SGlau laughing. SMG and she are sitting at a diner together.]

SGlau: [Stops laughing.] Oh my God, Sarah, your daughter’s so smart.

SMG: And… funny.

SGlau: Yes. Well, what does she like aside from Mother Goose?

SMG: Oh, she loves <i>My Little Pony</i>. She and I watch it almost every week
together.

SGlau: Wow, you're a pega-sister, too?

SMG: I'm not addicted to <i>My Little Pony</i>. I swear! I can quit any time.
Just let me watch one… more… episode. [giggles]

SGlau: Hah, hah. For your information, my My Little Pony addicts’ support group
meets every second and fourth Saturday of the month, and I am currently at step
five of our twelve step program.

SMG: Sounds like a plan. I'll consider joining.

SGlau: Cool, heh.

+++: Anyway, why did you schedule meeting me here?

SMG: OK, let's get straight to business. Summer: I’d like to hire you to star
in my latest production: <i>Sarah Michelle Gellar’s Summerschool at the NSA</i>
where you will help finish off an old and pesky nemesis of mine.

SGlau: NSA as in the National Security Agency?

SMG: Yes, these very ones.

SGlau: Sounds really crazy, Sarah. Are you sure you're OK?

SMG: No, I’m not. My secret for success was that I was never completely sane,
heh.

SGlau: [Uses her smartphone] Hmmm… I see DuckDuckGo
has some hits for “Summerschool at the NSA” and your name, hmm... and some
NSA factoids. Hah! “The NSA does not publish, they perish”, “The NSA knows
what you did last summer, but no one, inside the NSA or outside it, knows why
they should”.

SMG: These factoids would have been funnier, if they had not been so true.

SGlau: Yes, I see.

+++: So? Assuming it is something sane enough, which I doubt, why do you need
me to do it?

SMG: Well, see, if I were still 18, and a happy spinster, then I would do it
myself, but now…

SGlau: You are married and have children.

SMG: Exactly, I cannot really tell my daughter: “Hey Baby, mummy is going to
enter the Lion’s den.”…

SGlau: Or what the Bajoran scholars positively identified as “The Dungeon”.

SMG: Exactly. She would kill me if I did that.

SGlau: Hah, hah. I can imagine the headline: “Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played
Buffy the vampire slayer, murdered in cold blood by child daughter.”

SMG: [Giggles] Indeed, the apple does not fall too far from the tree.

SGlau: The apple completely supplanted the tree. The Golem has risen upon its
master.

SMG: [Thoughtfully] yes.

SGlau: Well, I don’t suppose she will murder you literally. You know,
<a href="http://xkcd.com/725/">xkcd number 725</a>.

SMG: Well, one thing I can tell you about parenthood is that such things
can progress from figurative to literal, extremely quickly.

[SGlau laughs.

A waitress arrives. ]

Waitress: Hi, hope you are having a good time. What can I get you?

SMG: OK, I'll have some peach infusion, and bring us a jug of water with two
glasses.

SGlau: [stops laughing] I'll have some Lipton orange tea, and can you also
bring a small plate of cookies?

Waitress: Sure [takes the menus]. By the way, what are you doing here?

SMG: [Looks amusingly at SGlau] We’re scheming.

SGlau: Yes, we are conspiring.

[They both burst out laughing.]

Waitress: OK… [looks puzzled] your order should arrive shortly.

[The waitress goes away.]

SGlau: OK, Sarah, assuming I am going to vanquish the NSA (and I assume you
don't mean physically, because that would be suicide and futile)… why?

SMG: Orders from above.

SGlau: Above? Like the president?

SMG: Higher.

SGlau: [pause]… God?

SMG: Lower.

SGlau: Between the President and God, I don’t suppose you mean the Pope?

SMG: Oh no… You realise I’m Jewish.

SGlau: That I do… Are you going to tell me the Messiah told you that?

SMG: You got it — the Messiah.

SGlau: Heh, who is the Messiah?

SMG: To keep a long story short - I am the Messiah.

SGlau: Sounds crazy, but I'm a very insane girl myself.

SMG: Do you want to hear the longer story?

SGlau: I guess, unless you want me to get rid of the NSA now, by orders from
the Messiah, which is none other than Sarah Michelle Gellar.

SMG: We’ve got a lot of time for that. OK: it was 1995-1996ish, Buffy started
airing and became a cult series. So, one day a group of Yeshivah pupils
from a local Chabad yeshivah arrived to the studios saying they have some
numereological insights from the Jewish bible, about what will happen in
Sunnydale next.

[SGlau burst out laughing.]

SGlau: [calms down] Oh my God, that's the craziest thing I have heard.

SMG: Anyway, we played along, and listened to what they had to say, and
actually got a few good ideas from that, and in one of the recess, one of
the Yeshivah pupils asked me out, and I accepted.

+++: So we went on a date.

SGlau: So you mean like the 1996ish Sarah Michelle Gellar, and a Yeshivah
pupil… On a date?

SMG: Yes! And I actually had weirder dates as a happy spinster.

+++: Anyhow, surprisingly, it was a very nice date, I had a great time, and
I learned quite a bit.

SGlau: Heh.

SMG: And one thing he told me was that every Jew (as he said) should believe
he is the Messiah, which is something I treasured since.

SGlau: So I presume I'm also the Messiah?

SMG: You got it. I am the most powerful man on Earth, and we should aim to
bring the end of days.

SGlau: Lovely.

[She thinks for a moment.]

SGlau: tell you what? OK, let's kick the ass out of those NSA losers, being
the Messiahs and all. I'm game.

SMG: Woo hoo!

[The food arrives.]

SGlau: Thank you.

SMG: Thank you.

Waitress: You're welcome. Enjoy your meal.

[The waitress goes away.]

SGlau: So what’s the plan? Gotta be prepared.

SMG: Here’s what I was thinking, but a lot of it is gonna be play be ear.

SGlau: [grabs a cookie] I’m listening!

[Fade to black. Cut]

[Captions: “Two days later: The NSA Headquarters near Fort Meade, Maryland”.

The screen fades in to show a parking lot, a car arrives and gets parked in
a vacant spot. SGlau wearing warm clothes, and sunglasses gets out of the
driver’s seat, she rubs her palms against her hands.]

SGlau: So much for summer.

[She wears a coat, and puts on a large full backpack and walks to the
guarding station. She enters.]

</s>

<s id="getting_clearance__at_the_guards" title="At the guarding station">

[There are two U.S. soldiers standing there holding machine guns - Andrew, who
is Black, and Daniel, who is a Caucasian. SGlau enters, and takes off her
sunglasses. ]

SGlau: Good morning, gentlemen.

Andrew: Good morning, ma’am! What is your business here?

SGlau: I am Summer Glau’s terminator from <i>The Sarah Connor
Chronicles</i>. I would like to get clearance for entering these premises.

Daniel: What? A terminator? Ma’am, are you crazy?

SGlau: Well, I am as crazy as terminators go. I have terminated Summer Glau,
the Hollywood actress, and assumed her identity, here is her passport and her
driving licence. [She hands them to the guards.]

Andrew: Looks legit, and the face matches. Holy shit, are you really Ms. Glau?

SGlau: actually - I’m her terminator. [she takes down her backpack and puts
it on the floor in front of her.]

+++: you may wish to know that I have a gun in that backpack.

Daniel: what??! Put your hands in the air!

[SGlau quickly puts her hands in the air, looking startled.]

Daniel: OK, do not move. Andrew, take a look at the backpack.

[Andrew approaches the backpack and takes a look.]

Andrew: Hmmm… several tablets and several smartphones, some bags with photos
of Ms. Glau - signed along with some… coloured dice in various shapes.

+++: Oh, here is the gun. It’s a toy gun, and it does not seem to be loaded.
The ammo is outside. What the hell?

SGlau: can I say something?

Andrew: yes, Ms. Glau.

SGlau: Ms. Terminator, please. Let’s suppose I am really a terminator. Some
kind of top-secret technology - who knows whose. Then if you shoot me, I won’t
be really hurt, and will proceed to kick your ass.

+++: on the other hand, if I am actually Summer Glau who has become a little
cuckoo, then if you shoot me, and I get killed, then you can imagine the fiasco
that that will cause when people learn I was killed.

Andrew: oh, man!

SGlau: yes, so I suggest you don’t shoot me.

Andrew: oh, man! Oh, God. OK, Ma’am, what is it that you want?

SGlau: just to talk, and hopefully without keeping my hands in the air all the
time.

Andrew: heh, OK, Ma’am, you can let go.

[SGlau lets her hands down. Andrew returns back to the counter.]

SGlau: so? How’s life?

Andrew: it sucks.

Daniel: it sucks.

SGlau: ninety-nine problems, eh?

Daniel: and a Bitch ain’t one? yes!

Andrew: actually, I have a hundred problems.

SGlau: ah, a significant other?

Andrew: yes, and me being a soldier makes her really bitchy.

SGlau: nice, what is her name?

Andrew: her name is Felicia, Ma’am.

SGlau: nice name.

Andrew: yes, nice name.

SGlau: I suppose serving here at the NSA is also one of your problems?

Daniel: hey, this place is at least ninety of my problems.

Andrew: I wish it was less than that for me too. I was actually
happier in Afghanistan.

Daniel: yes, this place sucks.

SGlau: I see. Can you be specific?

Andrew: how should we put it? We’re supposed to protect these idiots from
people who will know their secrets. And they won’t tell us what there is
to protect.

Daniel: yeah, and they are ungrateful, and rude.

SGlau: I guess that is what happens when you consistently fail to publish.

Daniel: yeah, those guys don’t publish…

Andrew: they perish, man.

SGlau: “Publish or Perish”… life or death.

Andrew: heh! Ma´am, for the stereotype of an actress, you are one smart
young lady.

SGlau: thank you! I had some good teachers.

[Pause.]

Daniel: anyway, talking about all that is a bit depressing. Ms. Glau, your
life should be happier than ours, can you tell us about it?

SGlau: yes, well. After <i>The Sarah Connor’s Diary</i> got cancelled, I’ve
been mostly out of acting roles, but I’m still hanging out there, not
despairing, and keeping myself busy. California is great for that.

Daniel: so, being the terminator was your greatest role?

SGlau: no, it was not. My greatest role was on
<a href="http://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd number 406: “Venting”</a>, what an awesome
panel it is.

Andrew: wow! So you're also an xkcd-head? That's so cool.

SGlau: Yes. I am so in love with Randall Munroe.

Andrew: seriously, so why don't you ask him out.

SGlau: well, the main reason is that he lives in Boston, while I am a
California girl.
